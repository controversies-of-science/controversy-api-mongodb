_Quasars, Redshifts and Controversies_
Halton Arp

_"What has happened in astronomy today, however, is that almost all telescope access has been shut off to the proponents of one point of view -- namely the point of view that current assumptions should be subject to observational test and that contradictory and surprising evidence should be followed up. The irony is that previously no more than about 5 percent of telescope time was given to projects that explored outside of the conventional, run-of-the-mill beliefs. To add this 5 percent additional time to the routine programs makes no significant contribution to them; it merely has the effect of suppressing all the discovery-mode programs. In a way, it is testimony to the extreme fear that the opposing side has of this kind of research that they would ruthlessly seek out and subdue this small effort. On the other hand, it raises the question of whether the enormous financial, engineering, and administrative effort put into astronomical research today is being wasted at the point of application by scientists who believe they already know all the important answers."_
