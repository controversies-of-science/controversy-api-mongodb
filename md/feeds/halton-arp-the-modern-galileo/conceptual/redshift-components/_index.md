Redshift components
Posted on June 20, 2009 by Ari Jokimäki

_"It turns out that generally an extragalactic object has two redshift components; kinematical and cosmological. In this post I’m going to describe how the different components are handled, when calculating things relating to redshifts of galaxies and their associated objects. When combining different redshift components, they are not simply added together. Redshift is a curious quantity in that sense. Let us consider a simple example of one galaxy having a cosmological and kinematical redshift components._

_The galaxy we observe has a peculiar velocity with respect to a reference frame that is non-moving frame local to the galaxy. For example, the Earth moves around the Sun, Sun is in motion around the Milky Way center, and the Milky Way is in motion with respect to Local Group, and so on. All this makes the Earth to have a peculiar velocity with respect to non-moving space at location of the Earth. So, when the galaxy we are observing emits light, the first thing the light experiences is the kinematical redshift that occurs between the galaxy’s rest frame and the galaxy’s local non-moving reference frame. After that, the light starts moving through space towards us. In the space it encounters something that causes redshift also. That is the cosmological redshift component. In Big Bang cosmology, cosmological redshift component is caused by expanding space. Many alternative cosmologies have different explanations._

_In the receiving end, there is the Earth’s peculiar velocity that also causes redshifting, but that is usually not kept in these analyses. Instead, the measured redshift is corrected for the Earth’s motion. Usually redshifts have been given in heliocentric reference frame, but galactocentric and Local Group-centric redshifts have also been used. Lately, the redshifts have been increasingly given in CMBR reference frame. However, it is quite common to just use the heliocentric reference frame. That contains some error in the redshift, but when dealing with objects close to each other, such as a galaxy and an object near it, then the correction due to Earth’s complex motion is approximately the same for both objects, so in practice there’s no effect for the Earth’s motion to the results in that kind of situations. Therefore it is OK for us to use heliocentric redshifts here, which is still most common frame where redshifts are given."_

See that webpage for a detailed explanation of how to calculate redshifts.
