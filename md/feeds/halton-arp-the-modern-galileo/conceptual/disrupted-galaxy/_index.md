_"When you draw in the minor axis of the galaxy, you see it goes more-or-less along the line to a pair.  And we will argue later this is kind of a common sense thing. And that is if a galaxy is going to eject something, it's going to eject it along the path of least resistance -- which is out the poles._

_It's very interesting that in some cases this monster or the machine inside doesn't eject it quite out the poles.  It maybe ejects it at an angle or maybe even in the plane.  And in that case, sort of all hell breaks loose.  You get fragments and and nearby quasars and very disrupted galaxies."_

An example:

_"This was in ... the early 1970's. There's this galaxy that's obviously losing it. I mean, it's coming apart. The arms are coming off, and so forth and so on. And there's this quasar Mark205 connected back by a luminous filament. We're going to a different level of proof here now. Before, we had the associations, the pairing, statistical, so forth ... But, here now, we have an actual luminous ... actual physical connection. Therefore, this stirred a tremendous amount of resistance, animosity and bad criticisms and so forth._

_This was taken finally ... I discovered it on the 200-inch and then this was a 4-meter CCD photograph which showed it.  And a number of astronomers with large telescopes said that the connection didn't exist.  And well, I mean, so it sat there until last year, on the web appeared this next picture which I was unaware of.  Some friends of mine told me about it.  And it turns out there's this amateur in England (from the English skies, which are noted for being poor observationally) with a 50-centimeter telescope -- half a meter telescope -- the CCD has taken this and the connection shows beautifully._

_I think that this is should be an enormous embarrassment for the professionals with the large telescopes, and an enormous encouragement to the amateurs.  And in fact, I hope there's amateurs here, cause I know the amateurs in Italy and other places are encouraged now to go over this whole group of objects and try to search for more confirmatory examples._

_But, I'm terribly pleased by this.  I'm terribly pleased that it came from the amateur community because they're the ones that really look at the photographs and really think about what it means.  And the professionals tend to be specialists and only look at what's predicted by their theories, and so forth."_
