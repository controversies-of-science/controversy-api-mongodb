_Quasars, Redshifts and Controversies_
Halton Arp

_"What every astronomer measures in the spectrum of a galaxy is the percentage by which a line is shifted from its laboratory wavelength. Astronomers habitually say they measure a velocity. That is incorrect. What they measure is a redshift, what they infer is a velocity. The only astronomer I ever knew who was meticulously accurate about this was Fritz Zwicky, who always used the term 'indicative' recession velocity. For consistency with general astronomical usage we have expressed large redshifts as fractional shifts (∆λ/λ), but for smaller redshifts multiplied them by the velocity of light in km/s as if they were Doppler velocity shifts. (The speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s)."_
