_"Diagram ‘a’ shows the path of light from the bottom of a spaceship to the top of it and to the bottom of it again. To a man inside the spaceship, the light traveled upward and downward vertically. (From a man’s frame of reference, the light traveled upward and downward vertically.)_

_Now, let’s assume that the spaceship travels in a half of speed of light. Then, the traveling light would ... look like diagram ‘b’ from woman on the ground’s perspective. (Then, the traveling light would ... look like diagram ‘b’ from woman on the ground’s frame of reference.)_

_The light traveled not only vertically but also horizontally. From woman’s perspective, the light traveled longer in a given time._

_Since the speed of light is constant, increase in distance means increase in time; time dilation occurs."_

_"It turns out that as an object moves with relativistic speeds a 'strange' thing seems to happen to its time as observed by 'us' the stationary observer (observer in an inertial reference frame). What we see happen is that the 'clock' in motion slows down according to our clock, therefore we read two different times."_
