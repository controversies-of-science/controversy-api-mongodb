_The Cult of the Big Bang: Was There a Bang?_, by William C. Mitchell

_"Redshift has a simple mathematical definition. According to Hubble's law it is equal to the shift in wavelength divided by the radiated wavelength. It is measured by knowledge of the frequencies of spectral lines of elements that are present in the radiation source. It is calculated by dividing the wavelength of a received spectral line less the wavelength of that emitted spectral line (giving the shift in wavelength) by the wavelength of the emitted spectral line. Although this can be simply stated, measurement of wavelength shift is not an easy task. The determination of the red shift of a distant galaxy requires great skill and effort._

_Galaxies that are relatively close to ours have a relative velocity that is only a small fraction of the speed of light. When their red shift has been measured, their velocity can be determined by the simple expression v/c equals Z; their velocity as a fraction of the speed of light equals their red shift. Their distance is equal to ·µõ/ùñº times T ú, or v divided by H ..._

_In our example of a 10 billion year old [Big Bang] universe, if a galaxy were found to have a red shift of 0.1, its velocity relative to us would have been 0.1c (or 30,000 kilometers per second) at the time the light received from it had left it. For an age of 10 billion years, that galaxy would have been about one billion light years from us at the time the light received from it had left it. Because its light would have taken one billion years to reach us, and assuming, as [Big Bangers] would, that it ws 'born' shortly after the decoupling, we see it as it was one billion years ago; that is, when it was 9 billion years old ..."_
