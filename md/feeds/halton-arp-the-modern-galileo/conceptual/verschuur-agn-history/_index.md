Chapter 11: Quasars

_"11.1. The Discovery of Quasars_

_While radio galaxies were often visible on optical photographs, back in the 1960s another type of radio source was found that appeared to have no optical counterpart. At the very best, astronomers might have noticed what appeared to be a star at the location of the radio source, but normal stars do not produce strong radio emissions. If those were stars they had to be a special class of objects and the name radio 'star' was adopted, at least for a while, until one of the most amazing breakthroughs in the history of astronomy._

_To set the scene, by 1963 the radio 'star' 3C 48 had been located accurately enough in position to allow its photos to be taken. It looked like a star. In that year the moon happened to pass across an area of sky where another bright radio 'star' 3C 273 was located. Because astronomers knew the moon’s position very accurately they simply timed the disappearance and reappearance of the radio source as it was blocked (occulted) by the moon and converted the timing information into a position on the sky. The observations had to be repeated for another lunar occultation in order to resolve position ambiguity, because two points on the circular silhouette of the moon could produce the same time of disappearance. The second occultation would occur when the moon traveled along a slightly different path, and hence the timing information of two occultations could be combined to give an unambiguous position for the radio source. In this way the location of radio source 3C 273 was pinpointed by Cyril Hazard in Australia. More than that, the radio source was a double, just like so many radio galaxies had been found to be double sources. Here the two components were separated by 20 arcseconds._

_This encouraged optical astronomers, in particular Maarten Schmidt at Palomar observatory, to photograph 3C 48 and 3C 273 as well as couple of other radio 'stars' and to take their spectra. Around this time the class of objects came to be called quasi-stellar radio sources, quickly abbreviated to quasars. Determining what spectral lines were present in their spectra the mystery of the star-like radio sources would quickly be solved: were they stars, and if so what type of star?_

_The photo of 3C273 produced an incredible discovery. It did look like to be a star but it had a luminous jet protruding from it. The double radio source found by Hazard showed one located at the center of the star and the other at the tip of the visible jet._

--

_At this point in the story the radio astronomical grapevine spread the news that the quasar spectral lines were utterly mysterious. These objects were not any known type of star, a discovery that set us all debating at length. What could possibly look like a star, produce tremendously strong radio waves, resemble double radio galaxies and yet produce so much energy? What made matters worse was that interferometer measurements of high accuracy showed the diameters of the quasars to be very small, which meant that they were surely not at the distances of galaxies because then their energy production would have to be even more prodigious with all of the energy coming from a tiny volume of space. That was also unacceptable to our imaginations._

--

_It was up to Maarten Schmidt staring at the quasar spectra before him to try, after several months of getting nowhere, a bold new approach. The spectra did not look like any normal galaxy, but what if the spectra were subjected to a large redshift? Unimaginable as it seemed to at first that worked. The quasars 3C273 and 3C48 showed a large redshift, which meant they were not stars but possibly galaxies of some sort. If the redshift was an indicator of distance then 3C273 was about 1.5 billion light-years away. 3C48 was estimated to be at roughly the same distance, which corresponded to that of some of the most distant galaxies measured at the time._

_By 1963 the mystery of the quasars had crashed about the astronomical community in full force. What sort of object could look like a star (even if one of them had a visible jet protruding from it) yet being farther away than most known galaxies? What could possibly be emitting so much energy as to shine more brightly than any other object in the universe? The energy problem was bad enough if these objects were stars in the Galaxy but for them to appear so bright while at huge distances seemed absurd._

_11.2. Brightness Variations_

_The mystery became heightened when astronomers discovered that the light from quasar 3C279 changed in brightness over a year. Furthermore, a subsequent search of old photographs of 3C273 showed that it had undergone sudden changes in brightness over a period of 80 years. This incredible discovery was also completely unexpected. First, astronomers seldom observed time variability in objects other than stars within our Galaxy. Second, quasars are intensely luminous and are a problem in physics even if the energy is generated over volumes of space of galactic dimensions. This problem becomes far worse if the emitting region was very small. Variability of quasar brightness on a time scale of a year means that the size of the emitting region can only be about a light-year across, a limit set by the speed of light._

_Soon after the discovery of optical variability in quasars, radio astronomers began to monitor them for radio variability, something that also seemed absurd at first, because most of the total energy from quasars was surely not originating in a volume as small as implied by the optical brightness variations. However, radio emission from quasars was found to vary in brightness from year to year, meaning that the luminous radio emitting regions were not merely very bright, but also very small. This posed an even worse problem for the theorists: how to explain huge quantities of energy being emitted in bursts from a tiny volume of space._

--

_After finishing my graduate studies in 1965 and being taken on as a staff member at Jodrell Bank and the University of Manchester, I was asked to propose an experiment I would like to carry out. Optical variation of quasars had just been reported, and so I suggested I begin a program to determine if their radio brightness also varied. To put it politely, this suggestion was laughed off as absurd. I certainly could not justify doing this experiment on rational grounds, but then at the time quasars did not seem to be very rational creatures! Radio variability was subsequently measured by Bill Dent at the University of Michigan._

_The full mystery of the quasar becomes more profound when all the information is considered together. They are very far away, and the luminous cores are very small. At the distances inferred by their redshifts, quasars emits the energy equivalent of a hundred billion stars like the sun, all the energy being generated in a volume of space not much larger than the solar system. Clearly impossible, or so it seemed, back then._

_11.3. Parent Galaxies_

_For years controversy simmered as to whether quasars were isolated objects not associated with clusters of galaxies, or whether they were the cores of otherwise 'normal' galaxies undergoing violent explosions. In the latter case surrounding galaxies may have been missed because the quasar so dramatically outshines it. A quasar may shine 100 times more brightly than a galaxy containing a hundred billion stars. (If a quasar phenomenon occurred at the center of our Milky Way, located 25,000 light-years away, the quasar would appear as bright as the moon.)_

_Painstaking research by many astronomers revealed that some quasars are indeed enormously luminous explosive nuclei of elliptical galaxies. These explosions are so bright that, because of the glare, we can barely see the surrounding galaxy. Only through use of very sophisticated photographic techniques and the largest optical telescopes have the parent galaxies been revealed in some of the closer quasars. Furthermore, because of the enormous distance to such objects, the surrounding clusters of galaxies are often invisible._

_11.4. Quasars: The Modern View_

_Today hundreds of quasars have been identified and some of the most distant show redshifts equivalent to 95% of the speed of light, which places them 12–13 billion light-years away. We are seeing those objects as they were when the universe was barely a billion years old._

_Observations with the Very Large Array show that quasars and radio galaxies look very much like one another with each showing jets feeding double radio lobes, as illustrated in the three images shown in Figures 11.1–11.4. Looking even deeper into the cores of the central objects, the quasars themselves, the Very Large Baseline Array shows blobs of radio emitting matter being blasted out at irregular intervals, the phenomenon that causes the optical and radio brightness to vary over time when the light or radio emission as a whole is observed._

_The next chapter will show how the saga of the radio galaxies and quasars has been united into an overall, comprehensive view, one that none of us in the 1960s could have imagined._

_Chapter 12: The Grand Unification: Active Galactic Nuclei_

_12.1. Cosmic Jets_

_The clue to understanding radio galaxies and quasars lies in their remarkable radio emitting jets. It’s all a matter of perspective. Long, narrow streams of highly energetic gas squirt from the center of a galaxy, emitting radio waves as they go. The radio jet in NGC 6251 is dramatically shown in radiograph form in Figure 12.1. It is 1.2 million light-years in length, which makes it the straightest and longest known object in the universe. The jet is a conduit along which energetic material carries energy and magnetic fields from the nucleus of the galaxy to the outer radio lobes. How are these jets formed and what holds them together? For the jets to be so long and straight a good 'memory' is required, something that allows the flowing material to maintain a uniform direction for a very long time, a million years or more, which would be the travel time of some of the jets if the matter flowed at the speed of light. But how fast is that material flowing? Where does the energy come from that enables them to illuminate radio lobes a million light-years away? To rephrase this, what inflates the radio lobes?_

_Radio astronomers have been confronted with these problems ever since double radio sources were first discovered; how can the radio sources emit so much energy, and how can they do so for long periods of time? A fascinating new explanation has recently been proposed. The jets obtain energy by transfusion in a most remarkable manner._

_Cosmic jets are the channels along which power is supplied from a galactic nucleus to the extended radio source. The innermost radio jet in M87 (Figure 10.4) is visible optically but most radio sources have jets that are invisible and nevertheless are radio emitters, sometimes showing associated X-ray emission. Jets are believed to carry equal amounts of electrons and positively charged ions out into the radio lobes, but only the electrons are observed, through the radio waves they generate. Radio polarization observations reveal magnetic fields parallel to the jets in the more powerful sources (when a jet is observed) and perpendicular to the jet axis in the weaker sources, although even there they are parallel near the walls of the jet. This magnetic field probably helps keep the jet under control and stable over long periods of time, otherwise the flow would become unstable—that is, lose its ordered structure—and quickly destroy itself._

_When radio doubles were first studied it was suspected that something had to be flowing out from the galaxy in order to inflate the radio lobes. While no one specifically predicted that such narrow jets would be observed, and certainly not that they would be such beautifully organized radio emitting structures, their discovery has turned out to be yet another exciting topic in astronomy. It is the jets that funnel energy into the radio lobes._

_Bulk kinetic energy (energy of motion of large masses of material in the jet) can be converted into particle acceleration in the jet through the action of turbulence (that is, chaotic motion) within the jet itself. Much of the energy may be generated within the jets as well as in the radio lobes and may not have originated near the central black hole. As the jets blast through space they draw energy from surrounding interstellar and intergalactic gases. To account for this, at least three mechanisms for adding energy to the relativistic particles have been proposed. Shocks, which are sudden discontinuities in the properties of the material involved, such as abrupt changes in density or motion, ahead of the jet and along its walls, create stronger magnetic fields, which in turn can accelerate particles. This process converts energy of bulk flow in the jet into relativistic energy of electrons; that is, the electrons are accelerated close to the speed of light. These particles, after radiating their energy, slow down to become nonrelativistic and hence no longer produce synchrotron emission._

_Turbulence in the medium can also accelerate plasma. Electrons may be reenergized by collisions with protons in the plasma stream. Thus we have particles continually propelled back to close to the speed of light._

_As the material streams outward, matter is dragged or sucked in from the medium surrounding the jet. This process, called entrainment, has interesting consequences. Whirlpools of matter, known as eddies, will be set up around the edge of a jet, just as in the wake of a ship. These eddies create shocks. The shocks can heat the gas to 10 million K and some of this gas then accumulates into dense pockets behind the shock. This entrained gas is predicted to cool to 10,000 K and show optical emission lines, which is observed in Cen A. By this time the gas will have moved as far as 30,000–300,000 light-years from the core. It is postulated that some of this gas will cool further, and stars will be formed, and this has been observed in Cen A. These stars will subsequently evolve, age, and die as they move out with the jet. Many will end their lives in explosive deaths known as supernovae and these explosions will, amazingly, become a significant source of new energy for the radio jets and lobes. Bear in mind that the material in the jets takes millions of years to reach the radio lobes, and therefore stars have plenty of time to be born and die during their journeys along these conduits into space. Entrainment, therefore, leads to a series of events, including star formation, which keeps the jet refueled and the radio source 'shining.'_

_12.2. Seyfert Galaxies_

_The radio galaxy and quasar story became clearer with the discovery of another class of galaxy that exhibit violence in their cores and which are relatively faint radio sources. The best known of these is a variety of spirals called Seyfert galaxies that show broad optical emission lines at their cores, the broadness indicating extremely chaotic, violent movement at the centers of those galaxies, motions which are not found in the more peaceful and normal spiral galaxies such as our own. Many Seyferts also show peculiar and distorted appearances on optical photographs. An example of a radio source centered on a Seyfert galaxy is shown in Figure 12.2. Their radio emission is usually confined to the core region and if a jet is present it is usually very short, less than a thousand light-years long because it cannot penetrate the surrounding gas and dust in the core of the spiral galaxy. Seyfert galaxies represent a class of objects that are neither a radio galaxy nor a quasar yet they exhibit chaotic motion in their cores._

_12.5. Active Galactic Nuclei_

_The manner in which all these inherently unbelievable and unlikely objects have been tied together in one grand unifying picture represents one of the great triumphs of astronomy in recent decades. The picture turns out to be surprisingly simple. It is mostly a matter of perspective; that is, it depends on how you look at it. Whether we see a quasar or a radio galaxy depends primarily on the direction in which the jets are oriented. If the jet is headed toward us we see a quasar. If the jet is oriented across the sky we see a radio galaxy. And whether or not the jet has to burrow its way out of a dusty or gaseous core of a galaxy determines whether one of the other members of the cosmic zoo rears its head in photographs taken from earth. That is where the Seyfert galaxies fit in._

_The common denominator for all these magnificent structures is that there is an enormous amount of activity, chaos if you will, in the cores of those distant galaxies, and that chaos can usually be tied back to the goings on around a massive black hole at the centers of those galaxies. This gave rise to the umbrella description 'active galactic nucleus' or AGN._

_A quasar represents the extreme case of the radio jet emerging from an AGN that happens to be directed at us. It looks like a point source of radiation so bright as to dominate its parent galaxy, which explains why quasars originally appeared to be isolated objects in the heavens._

_Unfortunately, there is yet another problem implied by the existence of core radio source jets that show superluminal motions. How come so many are pointed at us? Unless we occupy a favored position in the universe, those distant jets should be pointed in random directions as seen from our vantage point. After all, the jets do not know we are here. This created a problem until it was discovered that there are vast numbers of radio galaxies at large distances that also existed in the early universe. Only a fraction exhibit jets pointed in our direction. An observer in another part of the universe would see a different population of radio galaxies and quasars."_
