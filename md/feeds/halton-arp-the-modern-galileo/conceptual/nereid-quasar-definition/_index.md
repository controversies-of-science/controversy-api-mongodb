_"By the way, I am somewhat familiar with the history of the term and how its meaning has changed over the several decades since the 1960s; I am also aware that, today, observational astronomers tend to use a more general term, AGN (short for active galaxy nucleus, or galaxy with an active nucleus), and that 'quasar' tends to be reserved for AGNs whose estimated intrinsic luminosity is greater than a certain value. Of course, in the EU paradigm this makes no sense, because 'intrinsic luminosity' is estimated using the Hubble redshift-distance relationship."_

_"Those observational discoveries -- to which Arp himself contributed -- led to what is referred to in the Galianni et al. (2005) paper as 'the unified model of AGNs'. In this model, quasars, QSOs, Seyfert nuclei (both type 1 and 2), blazars (BL Lac objects, etc), most FRII radio galaxies, type 2 quasars, ... are all the observational signatures of a single type of object, the active galactic nucleus. The obvious (and not so obvious) differences between the different, observationally-defined, classes are due, essentially, in this model to differences in viewing geometry. So, for example, in blazars we are looking 'down the barrel', along the axis of a jet (but the bright disc may still contribute to the detected light); in narrow-line AGNs (e.g. type 2 Seyferts), the broad line region is hidden from our view by the dusty (obscuring) torus that surrounds the bright disc (note that the bright disc is completely unresolved -- it appears as a point -- in even the closest AGNs, even when observed with the highest angular resolution)."_

_"I'm going to get quite detailed in this post, so much so that I'm quite confident Dave will at least think 'pedantic!' (if not write it in a post). I make no apologies for this; in my view, science is being pedantic, systematically. The content of this post is grounded in the fundamentally quantitative nature of astronomy._

_What, observationally, is a star? Is it possible to define 'star' in such a way that astronomical objects can be classified as either stars or 'not stars'? Objectively, unambiguously, in a way that is independently verifiable (at least in principle)? This turns out to be trickier than you might imagine! And right off the bat you will need a third class, 'uncertain' - i.e. can't decide/determine/judge whether the object is a star or not._

_Oh, and please keep in mind that I'm concerned only with an observational definition; i.e. one based solely on what you can observe._

_Two observational characteristics are immediately obvious: a star is a point, and it's bright (i.e. a source of light); that leads to two semi-quantitative criteria we can apply to any astronomical object: it is unresolved (appears the same as a point would appear), and is a source of electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength between ~300 and 700 nm._

_To distinguish between stars and solar system objects, a third, relatively easy (in principle!) criterion can be added: a star does not move more than ~a few arcseconds per year, relative to some carefully defined framework. Why 'in principle'? Because defining the framework in such a way that the position of a 'candidate star' can be measured, robustly, and in a way that is relatively easy for others to verify, is a task that has taken astronomers centuries to get right!_

_Concerning point, as in point source._

_Alpha Centauri looks like a star, if you go outside on a clear night and look up at the sky (right place, right time, of course). However, if you look at it with even a modest (amateur astronomer's) telescope, it becomes two stars (there are lots of examples like this). So a star, observationally, is heavily dependent on the angular resolution of what you're using to observe it with. Here's another example: in any image of M87, in a visual waveband, lots of stars can be seen - i.e. point sources. However, if images of M87 produced using cameras (let's call them that) on the Hubble Space Telescope - such as the ACS - are carefully analysed, most of these point sources are broader (wider) than points (and are classified, observationally, as globular clusters ... though some are actually background galaxies, observationally)._

_What if the region of the electromagnetic spectrum is changed, to the UV, say, or one of the IR regions (near-, mid-, or far-)? Or the x-ray region, or millimetre microwave, or ...?_

_For regions far from the visual/optical, 'point source' is the preferred term; for UV and IR, both point source and star are used. As the identification of a point source in a Hubble image with an x-ray (point) source (CXOU J223603.6+335825), in Galianni et al. (2005), makes clear, astrometric alignment between widely separated electromagnetic wavebands is challenging (at the arcsec level), even with a robust astrometric framework._

_In the 1960s, a number of stars (defined observationally, in the visual waveband), positionally near 'radio stars', were found to have very high redshifts; they were given the (observationally derived) name 'quasi-stellar radio sources', or quasar for short. Others stars, with high redshifts, were soon found, that were not radio sources; they were dubbed 'quasi-stellar objects', or QSOs for short. Several were found to be not-quite stellar; they seemed to be surrounded by 'fuzz', an extended emission region, of characteristic size ~an arcsec or two, several magnitudes fainter than the central point. Many of the radio stars were found to be double-lobed, some with a central point (radio) source, some with 'jets', and some lobes clearly extended (i.e. not points)._

_And so on._

_Today, the term quasar is no longer used as a reliable observational classification; generally, in papers published in the last decade or so, the authors will take some pains to define what they mean by 'quasar' for the astronomical objects (and observations) they are reporting ... and a random pair of papers may have quite different definitions (an example: SDSS J092321.80+344342.8, or NGC 2859 UB 6 (or U06) in the 1981 Arp paper I referenced in an earlier post in this thread is called a quasar by Arp; however, when observed with the far better facilities today (than in 1980), observationally it's a classic 'starburst' galaxy)._

_But why does it matter? Why is it so important to expend so much effort on what, to a non-astronomer (or non-scientist), looks like the a dictionary-perfect case of being pedantic?_

_An example of what happens when you are not sufficiently pedantic about things like this is 'Further Evidence that the Redshifts of AGN Galaxies May Contain Intrinsic Components' (Bell (2007); hint: what's wrong with this? 'Since the VCVcat is made up of AGN galaxies from many different surveys, there will undoubtedly be differences in the selection criteria involved. However, since AGN galaxies are easily distinguishable from other types of galaxies, the normally strict selection criteria are not required in this case to obtain a source sample that is made up almost entirely of AGN galaxies.')."_
