_"There are three primary X-ray sources which you would naturally observe:_

_(1) One are disturbed galaxies -- Seyfert galaxies ..._

_(2) The other is quasars; they're compact objects emitting a lot of radio-material, but even more -- X-ray emission. So, they're very bright objects and something that an X-ray telescope would look like._

_(3) And ... clusters of galaxies.  Surprisingly, these clusters of galaxies are emitting huge amounts of X-rays ..._

_But, when the X-ray telescopes came along, they picked up the quasars very very well.  And you'll see this now was sort of a Rosetta stone for the main progress in this field.  And the thing we did next ... we looked at all the Seyferts._

_Because the Seyferts are such strong X-ray sources, we were able to get almost a complete sample of the brightest Seyferts from 8th apparent magnitude to about 12.9.  And ... the X-ray sources were then automatically reduced by the reduction program so ... they listed ... the point X-ray sources in the vicinity were listed, and what you see here is these points going up and to the right are excess X-ray sources around the Seyferts.  The dashed line indicates the control fields -- fields away from the Seyfert galaxies._

_So, we could see right here that this was an excess of point X-ray sources around these active Seyfert galaxies.  You don't need to be a rocket scientist to know that these were quasars, and everybody knew they were quasars._

_But, the question of course since they didn't have redshift, you could sort of ignore it._

_The statistics that we did on this was a 7.5 sigma result, i.e. the chance of this being an accident would be 1 in over 10 million._

_So, that this was what the conventional people said they really wanted -- was a statistical proof with a large sample of objects showing that ... these high-redshift quasars were associated with nearby galaxies._

_But, when the result was obtained and published, of course, no one would, again, pay attention to it.  So, we started this difficult procedure of picking out these sources and trying to get the spectra and getting the redshift of these quasars."_
