_"... Why did Halton Arp find so interesting the quasar appearing to lie in front of NGC 7319? Arp and several colleagues, all experts in the field, emphasized that the dense clouds of the galaxy's core obscure all background objects. But is the quasar really a background object 90 times farther away than NGC 7319 itself, as it must be according to official teachings?_

_Conceptually (that is, in theory), quasar cores become unfathomably bright when stripped away from the clouds of their 'host' galaxy and placed at the distances demanded by the orthodox interpretation of redshift. But given their lack of distinction in relation to other objects observed from Earth, it is surely doubtful that, at the presumed distances, they would have the luminosity to blast through clouds of a galaxy relatively close to earth — clouds that (if Arp's statement on the matter is correct) obscure other background objects. See the picture of a quasar here: [http://countinfinity.blogspot.com/2010/11/what-is-quasar.html]_

_It certainly doesn't add to the argument to show a different spiral galaxy, where the 'empty' space between spiraling arms allows a view of another galaxy behind it. :) Nor is it helpful to elaborate technical details that do not alter the fundamental considerations here._

_Arp and his colleagues such as David Russell are not the morons they would have to be if Nereid's analysis were a balanced statement of fact. At the time of his groundbreaking observations of 'peculiar galaxies,' he was the acknowledged world expert and the author of the most respected textbook on the subject. Yes, the questions easily grow complex, but the first requirement for readers interested in this subject is to explore the interdisciplinary foundations of the challenge. Start with the bold conclusions from those who know astronomy, are not irredeemably wedded to any orthodoxy, and have found that the evidence weighs strongly in Arp's favor ..._

_what observational astronomers know about the dust (absorption, extinction) inside galaxies ..._

_Dark nebulae have been known for centuries, even tens of millenia. For example, the Coalsack [https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap960503.html], near the Southern Cross which features in the flags of Australia and New Zealand, some Aborigines have 'constellations' which are patterns of dark nebulae in the Milky Way (including the Coalsack?), the Emu [http://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/AboriginalAstronomy/Examples/emu.htm], for example. A particularly spectacular one is B72, the Snake Nebula [https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap050521.html]._

_But dark nebulae are not totally dark, as these images of one (called B68) show [http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0102/]: in infrared wavelengths, the stars behind shine through:_

_Observational astronomers have, over a century or three, worked out quite a bit about how these nebulae absorb light. It turns out that they all seem to follow a simple rule: the amount absorbed in the ultraviolet is greater than the amount absorbed in the blue; the amount absorbed in the blue is greater than that absorbed in the green; the amount absorbed in the green greater than that in the red; and so on. Further, the ratios of amounts absorbed, in a pair of colour bands, is pretty much constant, across all dark nebulae, and no matter how 'black' any such nebula is._

_There are various names for this - 'reddening', and 'extinction' are the most common - and there have been many efforts, over the years, to produce maps of 'galactic extinction' - the amount of reddening along a sight-line, out to the edge of the galaxy; here [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9710327] is one that's widely used today. The amount of extinction/absorption/etc is usually written as the symbol A, with a subscript denoting the waveband/bandpass/colour in which it is measured/given; the usual units are magnitudes. For example, AV = 0.4 mag._

_Reminder: this is all observational astronomy; the only assumptions used are those to do with the nature of light (as electromagnetic radiation/photons); note too that an explanation of what causes this reddening is quite independent of these observational results._

_As observations of other galaxies clearly show, reddening happens in them too, especially in the disks of spiral galaxies (spiral galaxy bulges, and elliptical galaxies, do have some extinction, apparently, but it is quite small and usually hard to detect)._

_Another technical term: optical depth. If the amount of light, of a particular wavelength, absorbed is estimated to be 1/e (e is that famous number, ~2.718), the medium is said to have an optical depth of 1, at that wavelength. Quite by accident, 1/e is close to 1/2.5, so an optical depth of 1 corresponds to 1 magnitude (of absorption), approximately. This doesn't mean the medium is opaque!_

_Here are some results from the hundreds of papers reporting investigations into reddening/extinction in spiral galaxies other than our own (sample source [http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/317011/pdf] (PDF), another [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0007361] (arXiv abstract)):_

_* extinction follows light, in the disk: the brightest parts of a spiral galaxy are where extinction is greatest_

_* inter-arm regions are nearly completely transparent_

_* extinction seems to be clumpy; when observed at higher resolution, a patch of absorption in an external galaxy usually turns out to be several smaller patches, some with quite high extinction, some much less (this is what you'd expect, from the patchy/clumpy distribution of dark nebulae in our own galaxy)._

_Several regular readers will particularly like this paper [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0411663] (link is to arXiv preprint abstract): 'The Opacity of Spiral Galaxy Disks. IV. Radial Extinction Profiles from Counts of Distant Galaxies Seen through Foreground Disks':_

_Howlerda et al. wrote:_

_'Dust extinction can be determined from the number of distant field galaxies seen through a spiral disk. To calibrate this number for the crowding and confusion introduced by the foreground image, Gonzalez et al.(1998) and Holwerda et al. (2005) developed the 'Synthetic Field Method' (SFM), which analyses synthetic fields constructed by adding various deep exposures of unobstructed background fields to the candidate foreground galaxy field._

_The advantage of the SFM is that it gives the average opacity for area of galaxy disk without assumptions about either the distribution of absorbers or of the disk starlight. However it is limited by low statistics of the surviving field galaxies, hence the need to combine a larger sample of fields. This paper presents the first results for a sample of 32 deep HST/WFPC2 archival fields of 29 spirals._

_The radial profiles of average dust extinction in spiral galaxies based on calibrated counts of distant field galaxies is presented here, both for individual galaxies as well as for composites from our sample. The effects of inclination, spiral arms and Hubble type on the radial extinction profile are discussed.'_

_Now for interpretation._

_Dust in the interstellar medium (ISM) is the cause of extinction, and such dust has a size distribution that is pretty much the same everywhere, both in our galaxy and in others (there are exceptions, of course). Observations in the mid- and far-IR - where the dust emits light rather than absorbs it (because of its temperature) - together with spectroscopic observations, are slowly giving us a better idea of the composition of this dust, and the extent to which the gas/plasma in the ISM contributes to extinction, etc (quick summary: it doesn't, in the UV and optical wavebands; it makes some modest contribution in the near-IR)._

_How is this relevant to the observations of the quasar just 8" from the nucleus of NGC 7319?_

_First, the quasar is in front of/in/behind the bulge, not the spiral disk; if NGC 7319 were a normal spiral galaxy, little extinction would be expected (remember, spiral galaxy bulges are essentially transparent)._

_Second, NGC 7319 is not a normal spiral galaxy; it seems to be merging/colliding/interacting with others nearby, and there are 'dust lanes' apparently crossing/in front of/in parts of the bulge - so the amount of extinction at any particular position cannot be reliably estimated from models of normal spirals (this applies both ways: the extinction could be greater, or less; extinction is clumpy, remember)._

_Third, Galianni et al.'s [http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/426886/meta] own estimate of the extinction (reddening) of CXOU J223603.6+335825 (~0.17 mag, differential (B-V)), is consistent with that expected if it were in the background (one conclusion, in the second source above, is that AB is ~0.1 to ~0.3 mag in spiral galaxies when viewed face-on)._

_So, despite the impression your eyes give you, when you look at an image of NGC 7319, it is not so bright that quasars in the background would be invisible, nor is the region where CXOU J223603.6+335825 is seen necessarily opaque (pace Lloyd); and a century or more of observational astronomy points to 'open' as the only reliable conclusion as to whether it is in front of, in, or behind the galaxy (from the observational data I've covered alone; of course, Galianni et al. introduced much more observational data, in their paper, than just 'we expect the galaxy, there, is too bright/has too high an optical depth for a background quasar to be visible')."_

Can you produce evidence that might challenge Nereid's arguments?
