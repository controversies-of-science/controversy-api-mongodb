_"Chapter 16: Quasar Problems_

_Inconsistencies regarding the accepted interpretation of redshift data in estimating the distances of bodies in space results in many problems to BBT. Some of those have to do with massive bodies that are called quasars._

_Quasar Luminosity, Size and Mass._

_As presently utilized, redshift data results in the perception of the great distances of some quasars indicating their luminosities to be enormous. It is said that variations in the level of their radiation are as short as one day, indicate their sizes to be about that of the solar system and their masses and luminosities to be enormously great._

_A quasar having luminosity variations of one day might have a diameter of about that of the solar system. (The diameter of a quasar having a flare that swept around toward us once a day, might be 1/Tr = 0.318 light-day, 8.25 x 10⁹ kilometers which is about 70 percent of the size of the solar system based on the diameter of the orbit of Pluto.)_

_Based on that size, and on distances determined by the accepted interpretation of redshift data, the brilliance of some quasars has been estimated to be as great as that of 10¹⁴ suns, equal to that of 1,000 average galaxies. For example, Astronomers Courvoisier and Robson have estimated regarding quasar 3C 273 that, 'On an average day, it is more luminous than 1,000 galaxies, each containing 100 billion stars.'_

_The extreme estimates of luminosity, size and mass that are made regarding quasars suggest that the accepted interpretation of redshift data doesn't tell the whole story about the speed and distance of remote massive bodies in space._

_Quasar Clumping and Evolution._

_As presented in Chapter 11, based on that method distant quasars are believed to be seen as they were within as little as a few hundred million years after the BB. However, it seems impossible for them to have formed so soon after the BB, and, worse than that, that data is said to show them to be 'clumped' at great distances, requiring large numbers of them to have been formed and amassed too soon after the big bang._

_That clumping also conflicts with a basic tenant of BBT of smoothness, that is, homogeneity and isotropy. The universe might appear to be the same in all directions (isotropic), but it could not be the same throughout the universe (homogeneous). The clumping of quasars as evidence of an evolving BB universe assumed importance to BBers in the past as evidence against a competing SST that denied evolution. As a result, they insist that the matter of the universe is smoothly distributed, while ignoring the obvious conclusion that clumping and smoothness are contradictory ideas._

_The Copernican Problem._

_The clumping of distant quasars and Seyfert galaxies (called active galactic nuclei or AGNs) in all directions also puts BBers at the center of their universe. That situation, known as the Copernican Problem, is in direct conflict with the basic tenets of BBT that we occupy no special place in the universe (Copernican Principle), and that the BB universe has no center._

_Some BBers have denied clumping. For example, Cal Tech astronomer Patrick S. Osmer (in 1982) said that, 'statistical analysis is consistent with quasars being distributed uniformly at random ... These findings are evidence in favor of an assumption ... that on a large scale the universe is homogeneous.'_

_On the other hand, some of them have admitted to the lack of homogeneity due to clumping. For example, South African astronomer and cosmologist G. E R. Ellis (in 1975) suggested that, 'It would certainly be consistent with the present observations that we were at the center of the universe,' and as Joseph Silk wrote in 1980 and 1989, 'If the universe possesses a center we must be very close to it ... otherwise we would detect more radiation from one direction than from the other direction.'_

_Of course, Silk, a firm believer in homogeneity, didn't seriously consider that possibility. But If BBers were truthful, they would admit that quasar clumping puts them at the center of their universe._

_In an article entitled Everyone's Guide to Cosmology in Sky & Telescope of March 1991, Paul Davies wrote, 'In the real universe there is not the slightest hint of a center or edge.' But if quasars were clumped at great distances as other BBers believe, that statement could not be true. BBers can't have it both ways; either the quasars are clumped, or the universe is smooth and centerless._

_Clumping Due to Lorentz Transformations._

_The BBers relationship of velocity and distance as functions of redshift is based on the Lorentz transformations, as given in the equations of Figure 4 and illustrated by the graph of that figure. The perception of the clumping of distant quasars, that is believed to provide evidence for the evolution of the BB universe, is a result of that unrealistic application of those transformations._

_Due to the determination of their distance based on that accepted interpretation of redshift data, plots of the distance of quasars as a function of redshift are forced to take a nonlinear shape similar to that of the curve of Figure 4 which results in the appearance of greater density, that is, clumping, at great distances._

_A typical example of the result of that is shown in an article in Scientific American of June, 1998, by Professor of Astronomy at the University of Wales Michael Disney, who presented a plot of quasar distribution versus distance. (His plot must be rotated 90 degrees to illustrate that effect.) Furthermore, the perception of the sudden end of such clumping beyond a certain large redshift is not because quasars are 'rare in the very early history of the universe,' as he states, but merely because they are too distant to be seen._

_Quasar Distribution in a Smooth BB Universe._

_Despite the fact that they insist that quasars are clumped at great distances, and despite astronomical evidence to the contrary, BBers insist that the universe is isotropic and homogeneous._

_As an example, Peebles, et al. (in 1994) stated in no uncertain terms, 'in the big bang cosmology, particles uniformly fill all space'. But if the stars, galaxies and the rest of the matter and energy of the universe, including BB photons and neutrinos, are also said to have departed the BB and spread in all directions with the expansion of space, and are said to be smoothly scattered through the BB universe, that must also apply to quasars._

_Under BBT, or any other known cosmology, there is no more reason for greater percentages of them to be departing from us at great distances than there is for nearby galaxies, or any other matter in space, regardless of its age. That is an important consideration that should not be ignored."_
