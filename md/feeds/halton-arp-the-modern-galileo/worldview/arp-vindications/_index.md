Let's create a running list of vindications for Arp.  Can you help classify them on whether or not they've been contested?

(1) Alignment of quasar minor axes (vindication of Arp ejection model)

(2) Numerous apparent interactions of objects of wildly different redshifts (not possible with Big Bang, vindication of Arp)

(3) Numerous instances where high-redshift quasars appear aligned with the axes of low-redshift "foreground" galaxies (statistics indicate this occurs far too often for a strict recession velocity interpretation of redshift)

(4) Intervening galaxies are 4 times more prevalent along lines of sight to GRB's than quasars (shouldn't happen if quasars are at extreme distances)

(5) Quasars seemingly observed in front of foreground galaxies (has led to mainstream invocation of transparent sightlines through galactic bulges)

(6) A quasar that exhibits 10x superluminal motions at inferred distance (this is merely the worst case, but the most common examples of this are 2x superluminal; requires invocation of Relativity illusion)

(7) A quasar group so large that it spans 5% of the known universe at inferred distance (not expected from Big Bang theory because it's a violation of the Cosmological Principle that says that the universe is uniform)

(8) No observation of time dilation in quasar variations (no explanation has been accepted, to my knowledge)

(9) Quasars have been shown to exhibit proper motion (should not be possible at extreme inferred distances, and was once considered a rule for differentiating galactic from extragalactic objects)

(10) Quasar clustering (not expected from Big Bang theory because it's a violation of the Cosmological Principle that says that the universe is uniform)

(11) The Burbidges, Karlsson, the Bamothy's, Depaquit, Peeker and Vigier have all agreed with Halton Arp that there are preferred values for redshift, and numerous investigators have attempted to disprove it only to find the effect in their own dataset (Disproves the Big Bang's recession velocity interpretation for redshift)

Can you think of more?
