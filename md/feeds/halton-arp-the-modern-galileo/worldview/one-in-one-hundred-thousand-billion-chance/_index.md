An excerpt by Halton Arp from _Against the Tide - A Critical Review by Scientists of How Physics and Astronomy Get Done_

_"Scientific and Political Elites in Western Democracies by H. C. Arp_

_"Science is based on repeatable observations of real objects and the relationships between them. In order to avoid generalizations, however, we show here another specific object which demonstrates the foundation of current extragalactic astronomy and cosmology is fundamentally, inescapably, incorrect. Fig. 3 shows a radio map of a strong radio source. Two redshifts are measured for this object with one much larger than the other. According to conventional cosmology they are in different parts of the universe. But we see they are, in fact, joined by a bridge of radio material. The chance of this observed configuration being an accident is one part in one hundred thousand billion! Other examples like this have been observed where the chance of accidental occurrence is only one in a billion. But this would seem to be the ultimate experimentum crucis._

_The ejection in opposite directions of material from active galaxies, including very high redshift material like quasars, has been building up now for over 37 years. Yet the radio map shown here and the notation that this object had 'two redshifts', one a 'background object', lay unoticed and unchallenged in the voluminous literature for 4 years! When it was finally submitted to the Astronomical Society of the Pacific it was rejected."_
