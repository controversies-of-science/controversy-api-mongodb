The subject of gravitational lensing really deserves its own dedicated controversy card, but it would leave the wrong impression to make no mention of it here.

Gravitational Lenses - Proceedings of a Conference Held in Hamburg, Germany - 9-13 September 1991

_"In this connection, it is appropriate to recall the early studies by J and M Barnothy, who from 1965 onwards urged that all quasars should be interpreted as lensed images of Seyfert galaxies (Bamothy 1965). It is now clear, to an extent that it was not then, that Seyfert galaxies and quasars are a single AGN population, with no intrinsic demarcation between them. While it is not possible to interpret all quasars as lensed images, the currently tenable hypothesis that an extreme subset of quasars may result from lensing is only quantitatively different from the early Barnothy hypothesis, which was received with unduly short shrift, and even with derision, at the time, partly perhaps because it was associated with other highly unconventional cosmological ideas."_

_"Arp's arguments (published in the Astrophysical Journal in 2005) rest on the idea that it is very unlikely to find a background quasar whose position in the sky is so close to the center of the galaxy. However, his estimate of the number of quasars in the sky is too low, and misses the point that the gravity of galaxies (and groups or clusters of galaxies) will act as a lens, making it easier to detect quasars behind them."_

But, DID he miss the point? Let's look at one of the most famous examples, the Einstein Cross.

_Seeing Red: Redshifts, Cosmology and Academic Science_
Halton Arp

_"Prior to the 1950's Fritz Zwicky, the Swiss astronomer who had an illustrious and turbulent career in California, was aware that strong gravitational fields had been shown to bend light rays -- as in the famous eclipse observations of the displacement of positions of stars observed at a grazing angle to the sun's limb. At that time he started looking for an extragalactic object which might be directly behind another, and thus have its outer light rays bent inward by the gravitational field of the foreground object so that it formed a ring or halo. Some 'ring galaxies' were found, but they all seemed to be physical rings around the galaxy and not magnified background objects._

_The more common situation to be expected was when the background object was not exactly centered and the gravitational ring collapsed into a one sided arc. But no striking examples of that were found either, so the subject had gone dormant. The sudden revival of gravitational lensing to the huge industry it is today is simply due to the quasars. In the 1960's and 70's I started finding high densities of quasars concentrated around nearby, low-redshift galaxies. Because of their high redshifts, it was felt that they could not be associated with low-redshift galaxies ..._

_The Einstein Cross ..._

_... When it was first discovered it caused a panic because it was essentially a high redshift quasar in the nucleus of a low redshift galaxy ... Gravitational galaxy lensing had to be invoked for this one ..._

_'We put the slit of the spectrograph between quasars A and B in the Einstein Cross and we registered a broad Lyman alpha emission in each quasar. But between them we found a narrow Lyman alpha line -- it looks like there is some low density gas at the same redshift as the quasars between them.'_

_A jolt ran through me and I looked at him to try to read the expression on his face. As usual in such situations, his eyes avoided mine. The point was, of course, that a line between quasar A and B passed directly between the nucleus of the galaxy and quasar D. On the face of it high redshift gas was indicated near the nucleus of the low redshift galaxy. But what I knew, and what anyone can know looking at the Lyman alpha centered photograph in Color Plate 7-7, is that there is a putative Lyman alpha filament connecting quasar D to the galaxy nucleus. What the spectrum had confirmed was that this indeed was a low density, excited hydrogen filament connecting the two objects of vastly different redshift._

_Censorship at the Critical Point_

_Phil and I wrote all these results up in the best journalese style with all the tests, numbers and references and submitted it to the Astrophysical Journal Letters. The editor sent it to a referee who had just written a long paper on the Einstein Cross -- he had been looking for the fifth image predicted by gravitational lens theory, had not found any convincing evidence for it, but concluded anyway that he had strengthened the interpretation as a lens. He wrote three reports trying to get us to say our results were all the result of chance noise and then rejected the paper. When I pointed out to the editor the conflict of interest with the referee’s recent paper, the editor sent it to a theoretician with an even stronger conflict of interest. The latter essentially said that since it disagreed with current theory the observations must be wrong. The paper was finally published in Phys. Lett. A 168, 6, 1992._

_I feel very strongly about what happened and I want to make my position clear: Astrophysical Journal Letters is the normal journal for publishing new observations from the Hubble Space Telescope. The telescope cost billions of dollars of public funds. The vast majority of page charges which pay for the publication of the journal come from government supported contracts. The overriding, first directive of the editor is to communicate important new astronomical results. If the editorial process violates its primary responsibility, it misuses public funds._

_More Scandals of the Cross_

_Papers which claim that the data confirms the standard theories, however, are rapidly published. One example of such a paper is Howard Yee’s (1988) analysis which computed a required mass of about 100 billion suns inside the very small radius where the quasars are located. This leads to a mass to light ratio (M/L) of about 13 which Yee states '...is near the high end of that of large spiral galaxies ... but is entirely acceptable.' Well not quite. If you consult the original reference (Kormendy 1988), you see that this M/L is completely above the bulges for spiral galaxies, even above that for E galaxies and that is for a lower limit on the required M/L. In fact if you extrapolate the luminosity required for an elliptical to have this M/L ratio it comes out MB = -25 mag. How bright is -25 mag.? Well conventional quasars start at MB = -23 mag. so this galaxy would have to be 2 magnitudes brighter than the supposed brightest objects in the universe, a conventional quasar!_

_In a later paper, Rix, Schneider and Bahcall (1992) in a computation essentially no different from Yee’s derive the same mass for the galaxy. Their contribution was to change 'entirely acceptable' to 'lens models ... explain the wealth of observations elegantly.' Actually this so-called confirmation rests on the assumptions that the redshift dispersions in galaxy interiors represent both velocities and velocities in equilibrium. As we have seen the observations show this is incorrect on both counts and systematically overestimates the masses of galaxies. Furthermore the mass needed for lensing is underestimated by assuming it is all concentrated at a point in the center of the galaxy -- hence the lower limit mentioned above. Also in the matter of the Cross a disk galaxy is called an elliptical and mass-to-light ratio comparisons are shuffled between blue, visual and red. Even after all this one requires an extraordinary and unprecedented galaxy to satisfy the lens requirements._

_For realistic galaxy masses, gravitational lens effects may someday show up, but on a much smaller scale than currently claimed. As for the central galaxy in the Einstein Cross, one only needs to look at it to realize that it is in fact a small, dwarf galaxy. I think it would be an enormously helpful reality check if astronomers studied galaxies in groups and learned to judge the giant, medium, dwarf characteristics of a galaxy from its morphological appearance."_

Apparently, a couple of other papers have come to the same conclusion ...

An anomalous concentration of QSOs around NGC3079

_"We have found that, at least with conventional scenarios, lensing fails quantitatively to account for the phenomenon. A similar problem has been met in numerous other studies of QSO concentration around galaxies (e.g. Kaiser 1992, Rodrigues-Williams & Hogan 1994)."_

_"There is no valid scientific explanation given as to how a strong gravitational field would bend the light of a directly aligned background object into precisely four point objects.  The majority of theories and models of gravitational lensing actually predict a ring effect as the result of the bending of light around a strong source of gravity. In fact there are several gravitational lensing simulations available on the Web that visually demonstrate this effect. However I have yet to find one that simulates the effect supposedly displayed in the Einstein Cross._

_Theories, models and simulations can indeed be helpful tools but nothing can match pure scientific observation.  There are many examples of gravitational lenses that have been recorded by various observatories and almost all of them are in the shape of rings or arcs. The following image is a small collection of such 'Einstein Rings' as observed by the Hubble Space Telescope and made available from the HubbleSite."_

There also seems to be an issue with QSO luminosity ...

QSO-Galaxy Association and Gravitational Lensing

http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/1009-9271/5/S1/147

_"The amplification caused by gravitational light bending by compact objects in a foreground galaxy can affect the apparent number density of background QSOs, as well as their distribution in the fields of galactic halos. In this work we investigate the number enhancement of QSOs in the fields of galactic halos caused by point mass lensing effect and singular isothermal lensing effect, and apply the micro-lensing effect due to dark compact objects in the halo to NGC 3628. NGC 3628 is a well-studied nearby edge-on Sbc peculiar galaxy, where QSOs are shown to be concentrated around the galaxy with a density much higher than background. We show that if present understanding of the luminosity function of QSOs is right, such concentration could not be caused by gravitational lensing."_
