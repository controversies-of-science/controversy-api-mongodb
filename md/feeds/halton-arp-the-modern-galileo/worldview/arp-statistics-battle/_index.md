Chapter 2 of _Quasars, Redshifts and Controversies_

_"The Battle Over Statistics_

_As mentioned in the first chapter, after 1966, a number of investigations built up the evidence that quasars were associated with nearby galaxies. One of the first systematic investigations of quasars over the sky was an analysis I published in 1970. I was still a faculty member at Caltech at the time, and I remember well the custom of astronomy luncheons at the Faculty Club every Friday. I would bring in new examples of quasars falling improbably close to galaxies and share these photographs with my colleagues. Finally, the consensus was communicated to me that they believed these to be specially selected cases and that as scientists they could only accept the effect if a full statistical test were performed on a complete sample. I thereupon took about six months away from normal activities, enlisted the aid of Fritz Bartlett, a radio astronomer, to program the large IBM computer which Caltech then relied upon, and proceeded to analyze the position of all the then-known 3CR quasars (Third Cambridge Catalog Revised Survey of Strong Radio Sources) with respect to all the galaxies listed in the Shapley-Ames Catalog of Bright Galaxies._

_Figure 2-1 shows the striking result of those computations. It shows how the separations on the sky between a set of radio quasars and cataloged galaxies steadily decreases as brighter and brighter galaxies are considered -- that is, the association with these quasars is stronger as galaxies closer to us in space are considered. The powerful computer enabled many imaginary sets of random quasars to be generated and compared to the galaxies, and thus showed that it was only the real quasars which had this property of falling closer and closer to brighter and brighter galaxies._

_I returned with excitement and anticipation to the Friday luncheon and explained what I had found out. There was a unanimous response_

_'Oh, no one believes statistics!'_

_The paper containing these results was published in 1970 in the Astronomical Journal and little notice was taken of it. Eventually, in 1983, I utilized some of the clues developed in that paper to make the most recent and detailed proposals as to the location of quasars in space. These concepts are developed further in Chapter 5._

_But, other investigators were also developing evidence that quasars were associated with galaxies on the sky. In 1971, G. R. Burbidge, E. M. Burbidge, P. M. Solomon, and P. A. Strittmatter showed that among the quasars then known, those that fell very close on the sky to bright galaxies fell much closer than would be expected by chance. In a carefully worked-out statistical analysis, they showed that with even the few cases known from casual investigation, the chance that these closest coinicidences occurred accidentally was less than 5 x 10⁻³ or of the order of one in two hundred._

_The result was never criticized in print. As usual, however, it was excoriated in private. One of the major techniques for dismissing such results was introduced about this time. The catch-phrase is known as 'a posteriori statistics.' Normal people may not find that so catchy. But the idea is rather simple: After any event has happened, the probability of it happening in that precise way can always be computed to be vanishingly small. For example, if two people are photographed in the streets of a city of one million inhabitants, we would say that the chance of A being directly adjacent to B is one in a million. But in any random street scene there are perforce many A's next to unrelated B's. This is all quite evident from common sense. But what is also quite evident from common sense is, that if we continue to get photographs at different times and places of A next to B, we had better conclude some relationship exists between A and B. So far as the charge of 'a posteriori statistics' which has been levelled at each new piece of quasar evidence is concerned, the association of quasars with galaxies was demonstrated in 1966. Each succeeding example has therefore been an additional confirmation of an 'a priori' prediction. The dismissal of each of these on a case-by-case basis with the excuse of ' posteriori statistics' has been, at best, poor science and, at worst, a tactic of evasion._

_G. R. Burbidge, S. L. O'Dell, and P. A. Strittmatter in a later paper in 1972 showed that quasars associated with more remote galaxies appeared closer to the galaxy of association, as if the whole partnership was viewed from a greater distance. This relation is very important because it is what we must expect if we view associations through a range of distances, some associations close by and some more distant. The relation was later strongly confirmed over a much larger range in distance of the central galaxy and with larger numbers of examples in a paper by Arp in 1983. This is shown here in Figure 2-2._

_At first sight this result seems to contradict the previous result that quasars fall closer to brighter, more nearby galaxies. The key point to understand, however, is that nearby quasars are statistically close (closer, on the average, than one would expect by chance) to nearby galaxies and that more distant quasars are statistically close to more distant galaxies. But, the nearby associations can subtend a large angle on the sky and have rather large separations compared to the separations involved in more distant associations. The difficulty comes when people assume on the local hypothesis (quasars closer than their redshift distances) that all quasars are at the same distance and then try to analyze this mixture of quasars at different distances with galaxies at different distances. Naturally they get porridge. An example of this follows._

_In 1980, a test analysis was made by one researcher of some quasars which had been found in sample areas of the sky by objective prism techniques. (The objective prism on a telescope enables the selection of objects which have strong emission lines in their spectrum -- the stellar images among these are mostly quasars.) These objective prism quasars were analyzed to see how close on the sky they fell to NGC galaxies. (Perhaps indicative of the fast pace at which astronomy moves, the New General Catalog of Gahxies (NGC) by Caroline and William Herschel was completed by J. L. E. Dreyer in 1888.) The NGC contains over 7000 objects, most of which are fainter objects at medium to large distances. There are no accurate magnitude limits for this Catalog and in addition an inhomogeneous selection of objects was made. But the Arp paper in 1970 showed bright quasars to be generally associated with the brightest galaxies in the sky. Why did the later paper in 1980 try to associate quasars with more distant galaxies?_

_And, should it have been such a surprise when it reported no significant associations? Perhaps there is some clue to be had in reading carefully the words of the author as he coyly 'suggests' that the 'seemingly high frequency of quasar/galaxy pairs reported, primarily by Arp' may be due to 'uncertainties' in the adopted quasar densities used and 'it is this effect that makes many astronomers skeptical about the statistical significance of Arp's configurations.'_

_The true state of affairs was illuminated a year later by the only young astronomer to have ever regularly dared to test the claims of the establishment. Jack Sulentic analyzed the quasars just discussed as having been claimed to disprove association with galaxies. He analyzed these same quasars and also additional samples, but this time with respect to the bright nearby galaxies with which they were supposed to be associated. He found consistent and significant quasar/galaxy associations in all the quasar samples! Moreover, he found the quasars associated with fainter galaxies fell closer to them on the sky as would be expected if these fainter galaxies were more distant._

_All this poses an interesting question: Why, when the establishment believes so fiercely in the different distances of galaxies (as indicated by their different redshifts), do they always insist on testing the association of galaxies and quasars by assuming that all galaxies (bright and faint) are at the same distance from us?_

_We will see this obviously incorrect assumption used again and again in attempts to disprove the association of quasars and galaxies._

_A. Quasars near Companion Galaxies_

_During these investigations of quasars associated with galaxies, it became apparent that a particularly favorable configuration existed when a large spiral had an associated companion galaxy. Strikingly closer to these companions than expected by chance were found quasars._

_A representative selection of the cases is shown in Figure 2-3. One reason for this could be that the companion galaxies are younger and more active and tend to produce more quasars. But whatever the explanation may be, the associations furnish vivid evidence of quasars associated with much lower redshift galaxies._

_As this evidence built up, the opposition became more silent. I felt that one final test would enable a resolution of the question. Starting in 1978, I outlined a considerable section of the sky, defined beforehand what kinds of galaxies I was looking for quasars around, and started to make the observations. (The area of the sky sampled was defined by bright spirals with companions that were contained between the right ascensions of NGC 2460 and 3184.) For long nights on the Mt. Palomar 48-inch Schmidt telescope I photographed these areas in the sky in two colors in such a way as to be able to pick out the ultraviolet-excess, stellar-appearing objects which were the quasar candidates. I laboriously scanned the plates for the candidates and struggled with the spectrograph on the 200-inch Mt. Palomar reflector to obtain their individual spectra so that I might know with certainty which were bona fide quasars._

_Finally, after three years, I had finished. From 34 predefined candidate galaxies, I had found 13 cases where the quasars fell so close that the chances were, in each individual case, only about 1 in 100 of being accidentally associated. To find 13 such cases out of a limited number of trials implied fantastic odds against being a chance occurrence. I calculated about 10⁻¹⁷ (one chance in a billion 9 would be 10⁻⁹)_

_The result was published in the Astrophysical journal. A month or so passed. Suddenly the storm broke. Two papers arrived, each denouncing the probability calculations. They had been sent to the Astrophysical Journal Letters for quick publication and copies had been sent on to me by the Journal as a customary notification of critical papers. Both papers took essentially the same tack, that because I had used a probability of about one in a hundred of being accidental as a criterion for being associated, all cases where the probability was even slightly greater should be excluded. They wound up in the ludicrous position that associations where the probability was 0.012 or 0.013 should be excluded from the calculation as not improbable. (Basing my original probability calculation on p < 0.015, instead of the rounded-off p ~ 0.011 used, would have raised my final probability of accidental association from p ~ 10⁻¹⁷ to p = 7 x 10⁻¹⁶).These papers also used scaled densities of faint quasars to calculate the probabilities of finding bright quasars, despite the fact that it was clear from the literature that these brighter quasars were much less common. They also assumed that areas had been searched for quasars that had not been searched. These papers, after extensive refereeing, were never published. What did the damage was a paper that used the same incorrect arguments which was published with extreme rapidity by a British journal, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society._

_I first became aware of this paper when I received an unprecedented note from the editor of the main Astrophysical Journal. (The main Journal has a separate editor from the Letters section.) He mailed me a preprint of the paper which was to appear so quickly thereafter in the Monthly Notices. The note from the Ap. J. editor read essentially:_

_'We received this from the author and are conveying this simply for your information.'_

_Professional ethics required that both the author and the Monthly Notices send this kind of preprint directly to me. But, since from that day forward, my papers had enormous difficulties appearing in the Astrophysical Journal, I eventually understood what was the probable reason for this highly unusual maneuver._

_There was a further effect of the Monthly Notices paper, however, which presented me with additional problems. Another astronomer from the British establishment, who had been in communication with the first, sent a note to the Astrophysical Journal Letters which was eventually published. It took a different, apparently more valid tack. It pointed out that when I computed the probability of finding a quasar of a certain brightness at a certain distance from a galaxy, that I should also take into account that I could find other quasars at different brightnesses and distances that could also have a low probability of chance occurrence. In other words, there was more than one way of obtaining a chance-occurrence probability of about 1 in 100. That gave me a number of sleepless nights because I had to acknowledge that this appeared to be a flaw in my original thinking._

_After pondering the question deeply, I finally came to the conclusion that I had intuitively assumed that galaxies at a certain distance would possess quasars at a certain, characteristic separation from the galaxy and that other separations would not occur. Actually, this is just the relation shown in Figure 2-2. With considerable anxiety, I recalculated the probabilities in a completely different manner, taking into account explicitly instead of implicitly the distance of the central galaxy calculated from the conventional redshift criterion of its distance. I got the same improbability of association. I felt vastly relieved that my initial assumption had been correct._

_I encouraged publication of the paper that criticized this aspect of my previous probability calculation and accompanied it with a recalculation, by the different method, which confirmed my original results. Actually, the critical paper, even after making the most unrealistic and unfavorable assumptions, still derived an improbability of 10⁻⁷ that the original result could be accidental. This was still enormously strong confirmation of my original result. But the whole point of that paper was suddenly contradicted by a note added in proof (unseen by me or any referee) that referred to the Monthly Notices paper as disproving my original result. So the whole scientific content of the exchange was defeated. Reading now the papers, from some distance in time, it is clear that this was a rather effective double-play between two authors. In order to eliminate what seemed to be the inescapably small probability of chance occurrence originally obtained, one claimed that part was due to a large factor of error due to one cause and the other a large factor of error from another cause -- neither had to make a formal calculation from the actual data._

_An extensive recalculation on these data was later made by two other authors, E. J. Zuiderwijk and H. R. de Ruiter. It was reported in the Monthly Notices 1983 (see Appendix). With essentially the same precepts as the earlier authors, they found instead an association of quasars with the galaxies with an overall chance of only about 1 in 100 of being accidental. The reason that this still fell short of my original improbability is that they also ignored the fact that the galaxies with which the quasars are associated have varying distances from us. The absolutely key point is that my original calculation used a simple way of taking into account the different distances from us of the galaxies around which the quasars were found. To ignore this elementary piece of astronomy in which everyone believes leads to a strong dilution of the effect by looking in areas where quasars are not expected to be found and ignoring areas where they are. The nub of the matter is the following: When testing the null hypothesis, the assumption that the quasars are not associated, the last two authors find evidence for association. The burning question then becomes, why not test the hypothesis that they are associated, taking into account the varying distance of the galaxies? Why not repeat the test which gave the original, overwhelmingly significant association with the galaxies?_

_Of course, when two sides differ so sharply over calculations performed on the same data, one side must be wrong. If my side is wrong, I have to wonder whether I got the wrong answer because I wanted very much a certain result and this desire prejudiced my judgment on how to make the calculation. The other side would have to face the same question. Perhaps this is what is preventing the calculation from being pressed to the decision that it is certainly capable of._

_Finally, in 1983, a paper by myself was published in the Astrophysical Journal giving the final data on the observed fields and reanalyzing the statistics. Figure 2-4 here is from that paper and shows how the quasars concentrate between about 7 to 20 kpc radius around the particular galaxies that were sam- pled in that investigation. The average background density of quasars could not conceivably contribute significantly to the observed numbers in the small area on the sky in which these quasars were found. In fact, the density of quasars at these radial distances from their associated galaxies (in this investigation the investigated galaxies were all companion galaxies to larger galaxies) exceeded by more than 20 times the measured density of these kinds of quasars away from such galaxies. This result appears in Figure 2-5, where the error bars on the determinations from quasars of various apparent brightness class are also shown. All three magnitude classes of quasars agree that the excess density around these galaxies must be, taking a liberal estimate of the possible background density of quasars, between 10 and 30 times that background density. This is the same result that was the conclusion of the first, much maligned paper. Apparently the chance of accidentally getting an overdensity by the original factor of 20 is about 10⁻¹⁷ (or more 16 accurately, 7 x 10⁻¹⁶)._

_The final published data and exhaustive analysis, however, made no difference. It was sufficient for many astronomers to have something -- anything -- in print claiming the associations were spurious. This was brought home with particular vividness after a physics-astronomy conference in Geneva in November 1983. I was chatting with a British cosmologist about C fields and inflationary theory when the subject of quasars was mentioned. This theorist looked distressed and said apologetically: 'Well, I was interested in your quasar investigations, but then I was told your observational evidence had been proved wrong.'_

_It was clear that the research had been successfully discredited._

_But, before that I was even more painfully aware that the event had been used with disastrous effect within my own home observatory. While the critical paper that had been published so quickly in the Monthly Notices was still in preprint form, it had also been sent, special communication to the new director of my observatory, courtesy of the most eminent quasar researcher on the Caltech faculty. This occurred shortly after Caltech had broken the agreement to jointly operate Palomar Observatory with Carnegie Institution of Washington._

_Soon after this, a friend of mine met the director at the airport in Washington, D.C., and asked about me. The answer came back:_

_'Well, I wish he would get his statistics right!'_

_When I heard this, I went to his office and put down on his desk a copy of my final paper in which I had recalculated all the statistics using a different method and verified the original answer. Weeks later, in a talk with him, however, he spoke angrily about ludicrous arguments on my part and finally said, in effect:_

_'No matter what you do, you will never be able to prove that you are right. If you are right it will have to proved by someone else.'_

_Afterwards, I reflected that this was truly a serious crisis when a scientist admitted that he could not be convinced by any possible scientific evidence, and moreover, that personal prejudices played a part in judging the experimental evidence._

_Of course an infallible method exists for even highly placed scientists to get into big trouble -- that is simply to get the 'wrong' answer. This was vividly demonstrated, aside from the papers referenced earlier in this chapter which supported the associations, by the case of the then director of the Kitt Peak National Observatory, G. R. Burbidge. Together with some collaborators, he had submitted a statistical analysis on this subject. The study utilized the extremely valuable, complete catalog of all known quasars that had by then been compiled in collaboration with Del Hewitt. The sophisticated statistical analysis showed again strong evidence for correlation of quasars with bright galaxies. The referee's report on this paper excited wonderment in all those who gazed at it. As is all too common these days, the anonymous referee utilized trivial criticisms and inapplicable arguments against the paper. Since there was no sign of this obvious blocking coming to an end, or any intervention by the editor, it was sent to another journal. That journal sent it to another astronomer, who prides himself on his scientific intransigence, and it was rejected out of hand. Would the paper ever appear or would it become a rare, suppressed collector's item? Happily, it was finally published in 1984 in Astronomy and Astrophysics, another strong confirmation of the association of quasars with relatively nearby galaxies._

_Perhaps an equally vivid demonstration of how the publication of scientific results can be hampered is the case of a paper by the creative and knowledgeable French physicist, Jean-Pierre Vigier, and two collaborators. Seeing the attack on the statistics of the association of quasars near companion galaxies, they carried out an analysis of their own. Figure 2-6 above shows that they made yet another, but very elegant approach to the problem. They plotted the number of quasars found near companions as a function of the improbability of finding them. Then, as Figure 2-6 shows, they calculated the expected probability of such proximity if the quasars were distributed randomly with respect to the galaxies. The figure shows that even if the background density were an order of magnitude (ten times) greater than the value it is actually measured to be, the quasars still, very obviously, fell much closer to the galaxies than could be explained by chance. The fate of this paper did not involve much suspense. It was rejected without hesitation by the same journal that published the original, supposed refutation. This confirmatory paper wound up being published in the Comptes Rendus de l'Academie des Sciences Paris. A noble publication in the past, Comptes Rendus, with papers like this, might have to become more regular reading for those few astronomers who wish to know 'how it really is.'_

_Perhaps none of these occurrences would be any more serious than confrontations between opinions in science and human affairs of the kind that have taken place many times in the past. What has happened in astronomy today, however, is that almost all telescope access has been shut off to the proponents of one point of view -- namely the point of view that current assumptions should be subject to observational test and that contradictory and surprising evidence should be followed up. The irony is that previously no more than about 5 percent of telescope time was given to projects that explored outside of the conventional, run-of-the-mill beliefs. To add this 5 percent additional time to the routine programs makes no significant contribution to them; it merely has the effect of suppressing all the discovery-mode programs. In a way, it is testimony to the extreme fear that the opposing side has of this kind of research that they would ruthlessly seek out and subdue this small effort. On the other hand, it raises the question of whether the enormous financial, engineering, and administrative effort put into astronomical research today is being wasted at the point of application by scientists who believe they already know all the important answers."_
