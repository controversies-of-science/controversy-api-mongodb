It can be instructive to contrast the actual arguments by critics with attempts by conventional thinkers to summarize those arguments.  This is one of the ways we can identify the fundamental patterns of scientific controversies.

Some of these arguments are vaguely stated.  Any help clarifying the meaning of them would be welcomed.

_"... 7 NON-COSMOLOGICAL REDSHIFTS_

_In view of the apparent extraordinary properties of quasars, a number of well-respected astronomers have argued that the large observed quasar redshifts are intrinsic and not due to cosmological shifts that reflect the expansion of the Universe. The possibility that the observed shifts might be gravitational redshifts was considered very early, but Schmidt and Greenstein (1964) showed that an interpretation in terms of gravitational redshifts was unrealistic._

_Nevertheless, there were a number of observations which appeared to challenge the cosmological interpretation of the large observed redshifts (e.g., Hoyle, 1966; Hoyle and Burbidge, 1966). These included:_

_(1) The absence of any redshift-magnitude (Hubble) relation for either the radio or optical data, now understood in terms of the wide range of apparent quasar luminosities._

_(2) QSO clustering near galaxies: For many years, Fred Hoyle, Geoffrey Ronald Burbidge (1925 – 2010), Halton Christian ('Chip') Arp (1927 – 2013) and others maintained that the density of quasars in the vicinity of galaxies significantly exceeded that found in random fields. Thus, they argued that quasars were ejected from galaxies, but it was difficult to understand the absence of blue shifts in such a model. One not very convincing explanation was that light was emitted only in the opposite direction from the motion in the manner of an exhaust, hence only redshifts were observed. In a variation on this interpretation, James Terrell (1964) suggested that quasars were ejected from the center of our Galaxy and had all passed the Earth, hence we only saw redshifts from the receding objects._

_(3) Distribution of observed redshifts: Analysis of the distribution of observed quasar redshifts suggested that there were preferred values with peaks near 1.955 (Burbidge and Burbidge, 1967) and at multiples of 0.061 (Burbidge, 1968)._

_(4) Radio variability: The discovery of radio variability and especially rapid inter-day variability in some quasars suggested such correspondingly-small linear dimensions, so if the quasars were at cosmological redshifts the brightness temperature would exceed the inverse Compton limit of 1012 K (Hoyle and Burbidge, 1966; Kellermann and Pauliny-Toth, 1969). This issue was addressed with the discovery of apparent super-luminal motion which is most easily understood as the effect of relativistic beaming which can increase the observed brightness temperature to well above the inverse Compton limit._

_(5) Superluminal motion: Although relativistic beaming satisfactorily addresses the inverse Compton problem, it was still argued that the observed large angular speed could be more easily understood if quasar redshifts were not cosmological, and the corresponding linear speeds subluminal. Indeed, Hoyle, Burbidge and others argued that the relativistic beaming interpretation still required velocities unrealistically close to the speed of light. Still today, the physics of the process by which highly-relativistic motions are attained and maintained remains elusive._

_The arguments for non-cosmological redshifts lasted for several decades, and many conferences were held and books written to debate the issues. The apparent anomalies were argued to be the result of a posteriori statistics and in the case of redshift distributions, selection effects due to the limited number of strong quasar emission lines that could be observed combined with the narrow range of the observable optical window, and the blocking of certain spectral regions by night-sky lines. The arguments for non-cosmological redshifts only died when the proponents died or at least retired, but from time to time they still surface (e.g., Lopez-Corredoira, 2011)."_
