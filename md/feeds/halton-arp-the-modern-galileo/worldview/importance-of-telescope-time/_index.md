_"Scientific and Political Elites in Western Democracies by H. C. Arp_

_Evolution of an elite into an oligarchy_

_In the 1940's the largest telescope of its time, the 200-inch at Palomar, was conceived and built. Since Rockefeller and Carnegie were rival capitalists the Rockefeller Foundation could only give the money to California Institute of Technology rather than the Carnegie Institution of Washington where the world's leading astronomers were. Cal Tech, however had no Astronomy Department so an agreement was signed between the two Institutions that they would jointly operate the Observatory. The noted Carnegie astronomers such as Hubble, Baade, R. Minkowski then initially used most of the telescope time. Younger staff members were gradually included._

_Quasars were discovered in 1963 and astronomers rushed to observe them because they assumed their high redshifts meant they were at great distances and that the nature of the universe would thereby be revealed. The Cal Tech radio astronomer who isolated the positions of the first quasars asked for telescope time to observe their spectra and obtain their redshifts. He was told only certain of the faculty could observe with the 200-inch telescope. Those select few went on to measure the spectra and reap the headlines and the original discoverer left the field in disgust._

_As a Carnegie astronomer I was observing on the telescope but the radio positions of the quasars were kept secret and so I did the next best thing -- photographing peculiar and disrupted galaxies to see how they were formed and evolved. Ironically, in the end, they turned out to be surrounded by quasars which were obviously not out at the edge of the universe. That news was not welcomed by the observers who had inflated their reputations with discoveries of a new 'most luminous object in the universe' every few weeks._

_There followed an interregnum of about 17 years in which the Cal Tech astronomy Department pressed for a larger and larger share of the telescope time. One must know that in the operating agreement for the Observatory that the Carnegie astronomers were appointed full faculty members at Cal Tech. Then in 1980 Cal Tech broke the agreement, taking over the 200-inch and severing the faculty appointments of the Carnegie astronomers. There were bitter protests by the suddenly discharged faculty (Appeals to the American Association of University Professors were not heeded). In the subsequent allocation committees Cal Tech included only a few of the less senior Carnegie staff who then received small amounts of time but more time than the senior Carnegie members whose time was cut to nil. Telescope time was, and is, the currency of the realm, and in the competition for scientific preeminence the senior Cal Tech Faculty had just helped themselves to large bonus from the company assets._

_But it is not just a question of territorial expansion and control, there is also the question of eminence and prestige and the impossiblity of being wrong. This becomes clearer to me now when look back at the events of 1982-83. At that time I received a letter from the joint, Carnegie Institution of Washington -- California Institute of Technology, telescope time allocation committee. It was unsigned but it said that if I did not give up my present line of research they would not allocate me any further telescope time. I responded with data showing my publications and citations far exceeded those of the committee members as well as other senior Cal Tech astronomers. But the following year Cal Tech had taken over 75 percent of the 200-inch time. Next year my time was reduced to zero. I resigned my supposedly tenured position._

_This is how the elite body of astronomers, which is now the reigning authority in Astronomy, was formed. By now, of course, the students of Cal Tech have gone on to many other elite faculties and astronomers from Harvard, Princeton, Cambridge, etc. have arrived in Pasadena. So as with many self selected elites, their power has grown to be almost monolithic."_
