Statistics is perhaps the least exciting domain of science -- yet completely crucial to ensuring that science remains functional.  Many of the most important debates today in the sciences end up as statistical arguments -- where they oftentimes completely stall out.

We can choose to curse this fact -- or we can look at this as an important opportunity to learn and teach statistics.  I want to convince people of the latter.  When we run into a debate mired in statistics, these instances should become the vehicles through which we teach statistics.

What better way to teach a dry subject than to set it as the crux of a big question?  In that spirit, let's try to make these debates understandable by explaining the concepts and methods of statistics -- in a language which laypeople can understand -- that would be necessary in order to move these arguments beyond the statistics domain.

A common rebuttal to statistical claims of high-redshift quasars (presumed to be distant) with lower-redshift galaxies we know to be more nearby goes something like this:

_"We now know of almost a million quasars that are distributed randomly throughout the sky. Chance allignments of less than a few dozen do not explain the absurd number that are not alligned."_ (ScienceApologist)

... and this ...

'Setback for Alternative Cosmology,' by Joshua Roth, in _Sky & Telescope_ (December 2005), p. 22:

_"Ever since Edwin Hubble unveiled the universe's expansion in 1929, astronomers have used redshift -- the degree to which a galaxy's is stretched -- as a proxy for distance. In the 1960s the redshift-distance relationship enabled astronomers to make the visible universe a whole lot bigger by discovering quasars -- blips whose light had been stretched by unprecedented amounts. Quasars now have been catalogued by the hundreds of thousands, and nearly all astronomers think they are the extremely luminous nuclei of galaxies billions of light-years away._

_But a few dissenters, most notably Halton C. Arp (Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics, Germany), have concluded that quasars are much closer to us (and therefore much less luminous) than their red-shifts imply. Exhibit A in their 30-year-old case has been a handful of low-redshift galaxies with active nuclei. Each of these galaxies, Arp and his colleagues assert, is surrounded by an abnormally large number of high-redshift quasars -- suggesting that the galaxies somehow spawn the quasars and that quasar redshifts have nothing to do with their distances._

_Most astronomers have dismissed these galaxy-quasar juxtapositions as chance alignments on the dome of the sky of objects of vastly different distances. But their 'statistical arguments were just not that strong,' admits cosmologist Michael A. Strauss (Princeton University), when quasar surveys were shallow and sparse._

_Now, though, the 5-year-old Sloan Digital Sky Survey has enabled two Chinese astronomers to apply unprecedented statistical leverage to the controversy. Using Sloan's online databases, Su Min Tang and Shuang Nan Zhang (Tsinghua University, Beijing) found no tendency for 2,691 high-redshift quasars to cluster preferentially around 77,426 active galaxies with lower redshifts. Quasars 'are not ejected from active galaxies,' they state in their upcoming Astrophysical Journal paper. This, says Zhang, 'may serve as the last nail in the coffin.'_

_Then again, maybe not. 'I don't think the [galaxy-quasar] effect is in any question,' counters Geoffrey Burbidge (University of California, San Diego), an associate of Arp who has published what he thinks is strong evidence for physical ties between galaxies and quasars with discrepant redshifts. 'What's in question is the interpretation. People don't want to interpret [such relationships] in terms of noncosmological redshifts.'_

_And for good reason, says Strauss. To give just one example: if a galaxy bends a quasar's earthbound light, that galaxy must be closer to us than the quasar is, and 'in every case observed, the quasar has a higher redshift than the galaxy doing the lensing.' More broadly, if quasar redshifts weren't caused by cosmic expansion, this would call into question the entire Big Bang model, which successfully accounts for a wealth of astronomical and cosmological data."_
