_"The big deal was (and still is) that Arp. et al., do not do their probability calculations correctly, and therefore underestimate the expected number of close associations by chance, in a sky crowded with both QSO's and galaxies (which are not randomly distributed). Hence, their claim that the associations they see are in some way unexpected has no merit."_

_Cosmological Enigmas: Pulsars, Quasars and Other Deep-Space Questions_
Mark Kidger

_"A number of prominent astronomers insisted that something was wrong, however; despite the lack of blue shifts, there were far too many cases of alignments: more than would be expected if left to pure chance. The arguments about these cases became extremely statistical. In a nutshell, critics suggested that if you spread thousands of quasars and thousands of bright galaxies unevenly around the sky you are bound to get some chance alignments; the question was, were there genuinely more of these than expected or not? Careful analyses were published that suggested there were no more good alignments than would be expected by pure chance, even if you do not take into account the possibility that more quasars are likely to be discovered in the carefully studied regions around bright galaxies than in any other randomly chosen area of the sky.⁵_

⁵ _Often science cannot offer a definitive answer; it can only offer a probability that a particular theory is correct or not. In other words, all too often it is impossible to say that one theory is right and another wrong, we can only say that one is probably right and the other probably wrong. Statistics in science is just like playing the lottery -- even if your chances of success are tiny, someone (almost) always wins. A 1 percent probability may sound small, but play often enough and that 1 percent probability will come up in the end, so scientists will usually say that something that has a probability of 99 percent is only barely significant."_

_Quasars, Redshifts and Controversies_
Halton Arp (1987)

_"To summarize this initial chapter, I would emphasize that with the known densities with which quasars of different apparent brightness are distributed over the sky, one can compute what are the chances of finding by accident a quasar at a certain distance from a galaxy (see Appendix to this chapter). When this probability is low, finding a second or third quasar within this distance is the product of these two or three improbabilities, or very much lower. It is perhaps difficult to appreciate immediately just how unlikely it is to encounter quasars this close by chance, but when galaxies with two or three quasars as close as we have shown here are encountered one needs only a few cases to establish beyond doubt that the associations cannot be accidental."_

_Quasars, Redshifts and Controversies_
Halton Arp (1987)

_"Appendix to Chapter 1 — Probabilities of Associations_

_The basic quantity needed to compute the probability of a quasar falling within any given distance from a point on the sky is just the average density of that kind of quasar per unit area on the sky. For example, if a quasar of 20th apparent magnitude falls 60 arcsec away from a galaxy, we simply say that within this radius of a galaxy there is a circular area of 0.0009 square degrees. The average density of quasars from the brightest down to 20th apparent magnitude is about 6 to 10 per square degree. Therefore, the most generous probability, on average, for finding one of these quasars in our small circle is about 0.001 x 10 = 0.01, that is, a chance of about one in a hundred._

_The crucial quantity is the observed average density. The comparison of what various observers have measured for this quantity is given in Arp 1983, page 504 (see following list of references). Overall, the various densities measured agree fairly well, certainly to within 140%. For the kinds of quasars considered in these first few chapters this gives probabilities that cannot be significantly questioned. Of course, on the cosmological assumption, quasars of various redshifts must project on the sky rather uniformly. Therefore adherents of this viewpoint cannot object to taking an average background density, as observed, to compute probabilities of chance occurrences._

_Although quite smooth enough to compute average probabilities of association as done in the previous chapter, the cosmological assumption of uniform quasar background has led to some consternation for certain other kinds of quasars discussed in later chapters._

_Typically one astronomer will measure one kind of quasar in one direction and get either a large or small difference from previous measures. He will then argue that his measure is 'the' correct answer and other observers were in error. He will seldom consider that the differences are real. This has led to some considerable gymnastics to try to avoid inhomogeneities of certain kinds of quasars in certain regions. A good example of this is in the 1981 reference below, which tries to rationalize a difference of more than a factor of 10 in bright apparent magnitude, high-redshift quasars in one direction in the sky. In another instance, noted below, differences in densities are dismissed as scale errors when in fact they are due to the use of continuum magnitude systems that exclude emission lines, being incorrectly compared to broad-band systems that include them._

Here is the Arp 1983 material that Arp points to above ...

1983, Arp. H., Astrophys. Journal, 271, p. 504:

_"This cross in Figure 22 represents the density found by Arp and Surdej (1981) from measures in a field far from bright galaxies plus other similar surveys. The error bars on this point at B = 20 mag indicate the estimated uncertainty in average derived number (6.7 ± 0.9) and uncertainty in magnitude scale ±0.1 mag). It should be emphasized that in other independent investigations Arp, Sulentic, and di Tullio (1979) derived 7±4 and Arp and Hazard (1980) derived 6 (± about 1 estimated uncertainty). These values confirm the plotted cross in Figure 22 which actually then represents three independent, accordant determinations._

_The important point demonstrated by Figure 22 is that other available investigations roughly confirm the value of 6 ± 1 which was adopted in the present paper as the most probable overall background density for quasars brighter than B ≈ V ≈ 20 mag (continuum) or B ≈ V ≈ 19.5 mag (broad-band)._

_2. The second important point concerns the question of appropriate regions in the sky to select for background densities of quasars and also the large-scale clustering and variability of quasar densities over various regions of the sky. One much quoted value comes from the Braccesi field (Braccesi, Formiggini, and Gandolfi 1970; Formiggini et al. 1980). As discussed by Woltjer and Setti (1982), the field yields a density of quasars N(<20) = 19. But the Braccesi field contains five bright (Shapley-Ames) galaxies. Three of these have 𝝂₀'s between 836 and 1042 km s⁻¹, just the distance range in which we have found quasar associations in the present paper. The galaxy with 𝝂₀ = 836 km s⁻¹, NGC 4861, falls only 20' south of the border of the Braccesi restricted field from which is derived the density N(<20) quoted above. Quasar density enhancements have been shown around the companion galaxies in the present paper by a factor of 20. Around the galaxy NGC 1097, density enhancements of about 8 are encountered out to distances of excess of 10 arcminutes on the sky (Wolstencroft et al. 1982) as well as density enhancements within a 4 deg² area around NGC 1097 (Arp, Wolstencroft, and He, in preparation). Correction downward in numbers to allow for bright galaxies in the Braccesi field might actually bring that quasar density below the density indicated in Figure 22._

_Another case where quasar density has been taken from an area of probable quasar concentration and attributed to general background density is from the 4 m transmission grating prism survey of Osmer (1980). There the predominant area of the 4 m grating prism survey was centered on the richest (in quasars) area of the Sculptor Cluster where the observational evidence indicated the quasar density is too high by a factor of order 2 (Arp 1980c, 1982c, 1983). In fact, for strong line quasars, Smith (1981) has shown that the area of overlap of the Curtis-Schmidt 4 m grating prism surveys contains more than 10 times as many strong-line quasars as other areas in the sky. The area of overlap is principally in the area of the Sculptor Cluster._

_Moreover, in order to turn these objective prism quasar densities into densities comparable to UV excess survey densities, a multiplicative factor has been applied to objective prism densities. (This is because the redshift distribution for the UV excess surveys containing relatively more quasars without Lｙα and therefore of lower redshift.) But there is evidence that the Sculptor concentration of quasars is relatively richer in high-redshift quasars than other regions (Arp 1981c). Therefore the Sculptor region quasars may have been corrected to too high a value in estimating a comparable value for a UV excess survey._

_3. The final important point to discuss with respect to Figure 22 is the number of objects which are counted as quasars in color excess surveys but which really have narrow-line, low-redshift, galaxy-like spectra. Even some of these objects creep into objective prism surveys, but it is principally in the color excess surveys that they are important. As emphasized earlier in this paper, a certain percentage of objects appear stellar and have UV excesses like broad line quasars but nevertheless yield relatively narrow-line, low-redshift spectra when observed spectroscopically. This tendency appears to increase toward fainter magnitudes. Some very faint examples were encountered in the present paper. In this regard it is interesting to note that Kron, Koo, and Windhorst report (Koo 1982) that of 26 objects of appropriate colors to be quasars at B ~ 22±0.5, nine have narrow emission lines and only nine of the remaining have broad quasar emission lines. In Figure 22, the last band survey point has indicated a downward correction for this effect._

_With this kind of correction to the densities at the faintest magnitudes, there is undoubtedly a break toward less fast increase in quasar density for magnitudes fainter than about 20 as shown by Veron and Veron (1982) and Woltjer and Setti (1982)._

_How can we take into account the narrow line objects in calculations involving background? In the calculations performed in the present paper around companion galaxies, these objects are not much of a factor since only NGC 2859 U6 and possibly NGC 2841 U2 fall into this category. It would be very difficult to remove these objects from background surveys of UV excess quasars -- particularly if they are an increasing percentage as the magnitude becomes fainter. It seems best to leave these objects in both the background density counts and the counts in the vicinity of nearby galaxies and companions. There are transition spectra which bridge the gap between normal broad-line quasars and narrow-line galaxies, so the objects are implied to be physically related. This is another reason why it would be unwise to separate out the 'true' quasars. It would be better to study instead the range and distribution of the emission-line width as a function of apparent magnitude and, perhaps someday, as a function of absolute magnitude."_
