We can learn a lot about gravitational lenses by observing the thoughts of the astronomers who made the first claim.  Notice how the presence of two quasars of the same redshift in close proximity is by itself strong indication to these astronomers that they are seeing a lens.  There is no competing explanation at play for these astronomers; the notion that the quasars might not be so distant, or that they might instead represent ejections from the central galaxy is never considered as a possibility at the point where the idea catches on with other astronomers.

0957+561: The Unpublished Story

_"I was quite excited about this whole thing because, although 17 arcsec away from the radio position wasn't in terribly good agreement (in fact, it was poorer than the criterion for inclusion, which was a search radius of 10⁻¹⁵ arcsec), the two stellar objects were very, very blue. The A object is the bluest object in our whole survey, which is a fortuitous thing, I suppose. My proposal to Kitt Peak was joint with Bob Carswell, with whom I had been working since the earliest days of the spectral work. On our first clear night, we quickly got onto this object. Figure 5(a) shows the first spectrum ever obtained for 0957+561A. It was taken on 29 March 1979 with the IIDS. Anyone familiar with the instrument will know that this was taken at the telescope: we've still got the instrumental profile, which gives the overall shape. After 20 minutes, there are two strong broad emission lines, which were clearly carbon IV and carbon III at redshift 1.4. We couldn't reduce the data fully at the telescope, but the redshift was clearly approximately 1.4. Fine, we had a QSO. Then we moved on to object B. Figure 5(b) is a spectrum of object B obtained a few minutes later. There are two strong emission lines, the same two emission lines. Same redshift. Clearly, we'd made a mistake and had set on the same object twice. So we went back and made sure. We went back and forth a few times before we were quite certain that these two objects had the same redshift. We did all kinds of tests for light scattering and seeing. There was no contamination of one spectrum by the other. We had two QSO's with the same redshift. We got very excited and thought about this. We did not think right away that it was a gravitational lens. Anybody now finding two objects at similar redshift calls it a gravitational lens, but you didn't do it so readily in those days ..._

_This was the first time that a close pair of QSO's had redshifts so close to each other. Now, we had the first case of two QSO's with common absorption features. Bob went down to the 2.3-meter, while I kept the show running at the 2.1-meter, and came back and said that the absorption features were there. Ray drove back to Tucson as soon as he finished observing._

_Meanwhile, Bob and I were still measuring redshifts for a lot more QSO's. The next evening while we were having dinner, a telephone call came from Ray in Tucson that Bob took: he came back and said that Ray had measured the spectra accurately, and the redshifts of the QSO's in the absorption features were as identical as they could be. It looked like we had a gravitational lens. That was the first time that I recall those words being used. I think that it was probably Ray Weymann, who was the first to see the absorption spectra, who used them first. At this point, I had not yet seen the absorption spectra. However, I think that if we had not obtained the absorption spectra, we would have been very hesitant about suggesting we had found the first example of lensing."_
