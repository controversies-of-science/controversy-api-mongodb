_Quasars, Redshifts and Controversies_
Halton Arp

_"Fred Hoyle pointed out an absolute mathematical disproof of the cosmological nature of quasars. Mathematically he showed that in order to reproduce, on the cosmological assumption, the observed numbers of quasars as a function of redshift, their luminosity function must be very steep. (That is, at a given distance, or redshift, the number of quasars must increase rapidly as their luminosity decreases.) All the conventional analyses indeed require this very steep luminosity function. Yet as Hoyle points out, the observations strongly violate this requirement. You can see a dramatic example of this in the top of Figure 5-8. Between redshifts 0.2 ≾ z ≾ 1.0 there are a number of quasars between apparent magnitude 16 ≾ V ≾ 17 mag. If the conventional luminosity function were really valid, then we should observe ten times as many quasars in the redshift interval between 18.5 ≾ V ≾ 19.5 mag. Actually, we observe practically none. There could scarcely be a more clear-cut observational contradiction of the cosmological requirement. It may or may not be hard to believe, but many astronomical research centers do not even have the Hoyle publication. One center where I brought it to their attention made the reply that: 'Well, the mathematics are correct but the observations are not good enough to test the claim.'"_
