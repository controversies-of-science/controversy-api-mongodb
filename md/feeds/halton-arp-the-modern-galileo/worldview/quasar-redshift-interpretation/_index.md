_"This seems to indicate that the quasars do not follow the Hubble Law as do most other objects, and that there is no direct indication that they are actually at their proposed redshift distances.  In fact, it is argued that if Hubble had first been given the plots for quasars, he and other astronomers would never have concluded that the universe was expanding."_

_The Cult of the Big Bang: Was There a Bang?_
William C. Mitchell (1995)

_"Conventional interpretation of red shift observations indicates that large numbers of quasars are at great distances from us, resulting in the appearance of quasar 'clumping' relatively soon after the BB [Big Bang]. But the clumping of quasars in all directions would indicate that we are at the center-of-the-universe. That situation, which has been referred to as the Copernican problem, conflicts with the basic tenet of the smoothness of the Big Bang universe. The universe may be isotropic, but it can't be homogeneous; it may look the same in all directions, but it doesn't look the same everywhere._

_The postulated smoothness of the distribution of matter of the universe and the curvature of its space in accordance with BBT [Big Bang Theory] provides the basis for the concepts of space expansion and for a universe without a center -- the BB happened everywhere. But the clumping of quasars at great distances as determined by current interpretation of red shift denies homogeneity and a centerless universe. It puts us at the center of a nonuniform universe in direct conflict with BBT._

_The clumping of distant quasars also requires the formation of large numbers of them too soon after the BB. Cosmologists believe that it might have taken billions of years for quasars to form, and yet their red shifts indicate that they are seen as they were within as little as one billion years after the BB._

_In the past, the smoothness of the received level of microwave background radiation has been thought to support the smoothness of the universe. However, that radiation has been found to be too smooth to account for the presence of clusters of galaxies and for the formation of quasars so soon after the BB. Cold dark matter (hypothetical non-baryonic matter having no postulated characteristics other than gravitational attraction) had been proposed as a solution to that problem. But the extreme smoothness of MBR that has recently been established, that is incompatible with the discovery of quasars of great age and of gigantic galactic formations, has discredited cold dark matter theory in the eyes of many cosmologists._

_The BB that happened everywhere is explained as an inherent characteristic of positively curved closed space. That provides the rationale for photons from the early universe arriving from all directions as MBR. But if the BB happened all over, that rationale might be expected to apply to all the matter of the universe. All of it, including quasars, might be distributed more evenly throughout space._

_Like the stars and galaxies around us, rather than being clumped at great distances and of great age, quasars of various ages would be scattered throughout the universe. The observed distribution of young blue stars, as well as that of older cooler stars, throughout the universe support that even distribution of stellar matter. (A smoother distribution of quasars might help to support the smoothness of a BB universe, but it might support other theories as well.)_

_A lack of correlation between quasar luminosities and distances as determined by red shift data has been reported. A lack of spectrographic differences between quasars of different red shifts has also been reported. Both of these factors tend to indicate that quasars are less distant and closer in age than indicated by their red shifts. Spectrographic similarity also tends to deny the quasar evolution that is often presented as evidence in support of BBT._

_The present interpretation of red shift also results in high relativistic velocities and distances that require unbelievably great masses and brilliances of distant quasars. The highest red shift observed to date, about 4.7, indicates a velocity of 94% of c. In addition, rapid variations in the level of radiation of distant quasars (in periods of less than one day) require their sizes to be unbelievably small, and thus their brilliances and densities to be unbelievably great._

_An additional red shift problem has to do with quasar flares that appear (as observed by radio telescopes) to exceed the velocity of light. It is impossible to account for those that might actually exceed c. But it can be shown (by simple and straightforward mathematics) that flares having relativistic velocities that are ejected at angles of less than 90 degrees toward (or away from) the observer can create the appearance of superluminal velocities. However, it is difficult to account for the relatively large number of quasars that exhibit this phenomenon._

_Because of the great energies required to propel flares to near superluminal speed, one might expect them to be observed only infrequently. It may be more reasonable to conclude that the appearance of superluminal speeds is due to the present interpretation of red shift measurements. The mathematics that is used to provide the appearance of superluminal speed is directly dependent on the assumed distance of the quasar under consideration. That distance is in turn dependent on the interpretation of red shift._

_The problem concerning quasar flares can be demonstrated by the following example (which may not be totally realistic, but illustrates the point) of a quasar flare at a velocity near to the speed of light traveling toward us, but at an angle of 36.87 degrees from radially (using a 3-4-5 right triangle for this example). Simple trionometry can show that, when observed at one year intervals, that flare would appear to travel an arc equivalent to almost three light-years in each year, or at a speed of almost 3c. That apparent tangential speed would also be observed for a quasar flare traveling away from us (and appearing to be in the opposite direction) at an angle of 36.87 degrees from radially. The radial speed of the receding flare would be almost 0.8c from us, which (if it could be observed) should result in a red shift of almost 2. That of the approaching flare would be almost 0.8c toward us, and should result in an equivalent blue shift._

_Because flares might be expected to depart in opposite directions from a quasar with approximately equal speeds, the above situation might seem plausible, but it is erroneous._

_Let us assume the same speed for a pair of flares of opposite directions, each with velocities of almost c (at the angles and speeds discussed above), that are associated with a quasar having a red shift of Z = 3.5, and thus a relative velocity of 0.9c away from us. In this case, the flare traveling away from us would have a radial velocity of only about 0.8c - 0.9c = -0.1c relative to the quasar, and the flare traveling toward us would have a radial velocity of about 0.8c + 0.9c = +1.7c relative to the quasar. These are obviously conflicting and erroneous conclusions._

_The only reasonable explanation that can be suggested for these results is that the present interpretation of red shift in determining the speed and distance of massive bodies is incorrect ..."_
