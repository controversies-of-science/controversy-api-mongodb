The thing about this critique which is really quite surreal is that the images which are referred to as "the best ever" and "spectacular" are plainly complete crap.  There is obviously some distortion in the image at the crucial spot!  And not only that, but the author presents neither these images nor even a link to the original paper to bolster his claims; his readers must place faith in Mr. Kidger's judgment.  They are tricky to find and quite small; I got mine at http://heritage.stsci.edu/2002/23/supplemental.html.

_Cosmological Enigmas: Pulsars, Quasars and Other Deep-Space Questions_

(Note: Curiously, this mainstream text offers arguments against Arp without showing any of his astronomical imagery.  Figure 9.1 is the same optical image which Arp made a point of producing a negative of.  It's caption reads: _"Figure 9.1. The Hubble Space Telescope image of the field of NGC 4319 and Markarian 205 in approximately true color. Note that many faint and distant galaxies can be seen in the image, at least two of which can be seen clearly shining through the disk of the galaxy. The galaxy that hosts Markarian 205 is clearly visible and partially superimposes on the spiral galaxy. The bright starlike object just to the lower left of Markarian 205 is another galaxy at the same red shift as the quasar."_)

_"Most controversial of all have been the proposed cases of physical connections between quasars and galaxies. Of these, the most famous case is the pairing of the bright galaxy NGC 4319 and the quasar Markarian 205 (see figure 9.1). The quasar Markarian 205 apparently lies within the outer spiral arm of the barred spiral galaxy NGC 4319. The red shift of the galaxy (0.00468) corresponds to a distance of only 80 million light years, while the red shift of the quasar (0.071) is equivalent to a distance of approximately 1 billion light years. What interested Halton Arp was the fact that, although the quasar has a red shift suggesting that it is 13 times more distant than the bright and nearby galaxy, there appears to be a faint luminous bridge of material linking the two. If the red shift is telling the truth, it is impossible that galaxy and quasar can be physically connected._

_For many years a controversy raged about this pairing. Critics argued that the luminous bridge was either an artifact of the processing of the images or due to the casual interpositioning of another galaxy between Markarian 205 and NGC 4319. Conspiracy theorists denounced mainstream science for not taking Arp seriously and suggested that their refusal to refute his arguments was proof of their fear of his views. It was even suggested there was pressure to stop scientists observing Markarian 205 with the Hubble Space Telescope in case they proved that Arp was right._

_In 2002 Roger Knacke of Penn State Erie observed the pairing with the Hubble Space Telescope, producing some spectacular images. For most astronomers, previous spectroscopic observations taken with the telescope in 1991 had just about settled the case. Those observations showed the galaxy absorbed light from the quasar (in other words, there was a series of dark absorption lines in the spectrum of the quasar that were caused by light from the quasar being absorbed by cool gas in the galaxy’s spiral arms). Knacke’s images of the pair were the best ever, with a resolution many times better than the original ones published by Arp in 1971. The results were spectacular. Markarian 205 lies in a quite normal galaxy with a hint of spiral arms. The brightness of the galaxy is consistent with its distance calculated from the red shift. There is also a much fainter and less well known companion of Markarian 205 clearly shown in the Hubble images that is another compact but much fainter galaxy at the same red shift as Markarian 205. This forms a genuine pairing with only a small separation in space._

_These images have not closed the issue of the luminous connection between quasar and galaxy; however, they have greatly reduced its importance. In the original photographic images published by Arp in 1971, the connection appeared to be quite clear and obvious. Despite the enormous resolution and detail in the Hubble images, this luminous bridge is seen less clearly than ever. Most scientists suspect it is a random wisp of structure in one or the other of the two galaxies, although there is no really clear explanation. One detail that makes one suspicious is that the lower the resolution of the images, the more clearly it is seen, which suggests that it is due more to some optical effect than to a real structure._

_At the end of the second millennium most astronomers felt that the controversy over the cosmological red shift had really been closed. Although a tiny minority of scientists continues to express doubts, the general opinion that the red shift is cosmological—in other words, that it does indicate that quasars and, increasingly, faint galaxies are at enormous distances—seems to have overcome all reasonable doubts and tests ..."_

Tom Bridgman apparently did not think so much of these images because he did not include them with his critique ...
