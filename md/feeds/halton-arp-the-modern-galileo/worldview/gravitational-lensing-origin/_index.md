_"Introduction_

_Hamburg is a specially appropriate location for a conference on gravitational lensing, because the astronomers here, under the leadership of Professor Refsdal, are responsible for many of the important advances in the subject. Indeed, I feel it would really have been appropriate for Professor Refsdal to have given an introductory talk himself. He has written some of the classic papers, and has been a leader in the subject for more than 25 years. All I can offer is an external perspective on gravitational lensing, emphasizing its actual and potential impact on other topics in astrophysics. Gravitational lensing enables us to probe the distribution of all gravitating matter (including the often-dominant dark matter), in galaxies, clusters, and superclusters. Lensing allows us to probe the structure of quasars, with an angular resolution better than a micro-arcsecond, and to see magnified images of faint remote galaxies lying behind clusters. Lensing offers also a diagnostic of the nature of the dark matter, particularly if it consists of discrete compact objects; it also offers new tests of cosmological models, and an independent method of determining Hubble's constant. And finally, lensing may reveal new exotic types of object, such as cosmic strings._

_General Features of Lensing by Extragalactic Objects_

_Gravitational lensing is an application of light bending, which is of course one of the classic tests of Einstein's general relativity. The subject has a theoretical history going right back to the 1920s. Very early on it was realised that lensing of stars by other stars within the galaxy was highly improbable. But Zwicky (1937) already realised that lensing by galaxies was more probable, because the effective cross-section for lensing by a given mass is proportional to the path length._

_The modern era of gravitational lens research started in the 1960s, with further papers on lensing by stars, and with the important suggestion by Refsdal (1964) that in principle the Hubble constant could be determined by measurements of the light travel time difference between the two images of a distant quasar. In another paper, in 1970, Refsdal quantified Zwicky's earlier estimate of the probability of lensing, showing that if there exists a population of sufficiently compact objects contributing a fraction ùõ∫ùëô of the critical density, then_

_p ‚ãç ùõ∫ùëô min [1,z¬≤] (1)_

_This probability is independent of the mass of the individual lenses, because the cross-section is proportional to M. The angular size of the image scales as M ¬Ω, and for galactic masses is of order an arcsecond. It is therefore fortunate that the dominant features of the universe are indeed entities whose mass allows them to give optically-resolvable multiple lens images._

_Some of the theory relevant to lensing by galaxies was worked out in the 1970s (e.g. Sanitt 1971; Bourassa and Kantowski 1975, and earlier papers cited therein), but the subject of course received its boost in 1979, with the discovery of the first instance of lensing, the famous double quasar 0957+561. Other lensing phenomena have subsequently been discovered: the arcs in clusters, due to magnification and distortion of faint background galaxies, in 1986; the first radio Einstein ring in 1988; and evidence for microlensing in 1989. The volume of research activity on lensing has risen sharply, and amounts now to about 200 papers per year. For this reason, I shall not, in the present introductory survey, attempt to give detailed specific references to the points I discuss, most of which will in any case be explored more fully by later speakers._

_When the source being lensed has a redshift z‚â≥1, the relation between the lens mass and the image separation angle 0 can simply be expressed if we define a mass MH, equal to ùúåùëê (ct ú)¬≥. This is in effect the mass within a Hubble volume in a universe with the critical density ùúåùëê = (‚Å∏/‚ÇÉ ùúãGt¬≤ ú)‚Åª¬π, where t ú is the Hubble time. In terms of this quantity we can write_

_ùúΩ ‚ãç (Mùëô/M ú)¬π/‚ÇÇ radians (2)_

_For an extended object at a cosmological distance to images, its density must satisfy_

_ùúå/ùúåùëê > ùúΩ‚Åª¬π (3)_

_In other words, the surface density of the lens must exceed the mean column density out to the Hubble distance in a flat universe. For galaxies, this criterion is marginally satisfied. This means that multiple images can be expected, but the optics is more complicated than in the standard point mass case. We shall be hearing about the theory of gravitational imaging in the next talk, by Ramesh Narayan. The situation in essence resembles ray propagation through a medium whose refractive index varies from place to place. The refractive index differs from unity by a quantity 2Œ¶/c¬≤, where Œ¶ is the Newtonian potential. In most applications, we have the simplification that the bending angles are small. Also, of course, lensing is an achromatic phenomenon. It is also useful to think in terms of the distortion of the wave fronts by the variable refractive index. One can then see, as later speakers will discuss more fully, how multiple images can result if the effective focal length is shorter than the distance to the source. Caustic surfaces, where pairs of images merge, play an important role in the optics; the light travel times may be different along the different paths._

_Imaging by Galactic Potentials_

_In modelling a galaxy, the gravitating effect of the dark halo must be included; as a first approximation, one might therefore consider a model for an isothermal sphere with a specific core radius. In this case, the bending angle for light rays passing outside the core is independent of impact parameter, being related to the velocity dispersion. For sufficiently close alignments, three images are seen; the central one, corresponding to light passing through the core, is very weak if the core radius is small. If we introduce the further complication of ellipticity, the image structure is more complicated. There is a range of source positions, corresponding to very close alignment with the lens, where 5 images are seen. Further out, there is an annular region where 3 images occur, rather as in the isothermal sphere, and for sufficiently large impact parameters there is of course no multiple imaging at all. It is remarkable that the known cases of lensing can be modelled satisfactorily by a spheroidal mass distribution of this kind. In particular, this model can be applied to both of the best-studied and best-established lenses. Because we shall be hearing so much about them, I will mention their basic properties here._

_The first gravitational lens, 0957+561, was discovered by Walsh et al. (1979). The redshift of the background quasar is 1.41. The two images are split by 6 seconds of arc, and the lensing object is a galaxy with redshift 0.36 displaced by 1 arcsecond from one of the images. The galaxy is in a cluster, and models of the system attribute the rather wide separation of the images to focusing by the cluster mass distribution. The quasar is a radio source, and radio structure, on both the VLA and VLBI scale, is seen in each image. The existence of VLBI jets, pointing in more-or-less the same direction in both of the images, is absolutely clinching evidence that this is indeed a lens. The radio structure, of course, provides more parameters that must be fitted by an acceptable model. The background quasar is variable, both at optical and at radio wavelengths, and we shall be hearing a lot at this meeting about the measurement of the time delay, and its possible implications for the Hubble constant._

_A second system of particular interest is 2237+031 (Huchra et al. 1985). Here, a background quasar with redshift 1.69 is almost precisely aligned with a relatively nearby galaxy, a barred spiral with redshift 0.04. There are 4 images, within a spacing of about 2 arcseconds, symmetrically disposed around the centre of the foreground galaxy. This system again can be fitted by an ellipsoidal mass distribution, according to which there would be a faint 5th image right at the centre. This system was discovered accidentally; and, indeed, it must be regarded as a rather improbable and fortunate accident that such a precise alignment exists with a nearby galaxy. There has consequently been scepticism in some quarters about whether it really is a lens. All that can be said in rebuttal is that it would be even more remarkable if the 4 images, all with the same redshift, existed for some other reason, in a configuration which can be so well modelled by the lensing hypothesis. The lines of sight to the images pass within the central part of the galaxy, where one would expect the dominant mass to be in the ordinary stars rather than in dark matter. This should be borne in mind in discussing the evidence for microlensing which has now been seen in one, and perhaps now even in a second, of the images."_
