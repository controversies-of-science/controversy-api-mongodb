A common reaction to Halton Arp's quasar ejection hypothesis is to point to the numerous quasars which lack any obvious parent.

If you see a person asking this question, it's probably a clue that they've never actually read Arp, and they're not thinking too deeply about the problem either.  The simple answer is that nearby objects (and their companions) are spread wider across the sky than the farther ones. This is perspective 101.

To take a specific example, the quasars Arp associated with M33 stretch a full 45° across the sky -- much wider than the 1° usually allowed for galaxy/quasar pairs.  That's because M33 is of course one of the closest spiral galaxies to the Milky Way.

Arp addresses this exact point in more technical terms in his 1987 text, _Quasars, Redshifts and Controversies_.

Arp's Short Answer:

_"G. R. Burbidge, S. L. O'Dell, and P. A. Strittmatter in a later paper in 1972 showed that quasars associated with more remote galaxies appeared closer to the galaxy of association, as if the whole partnership was viewed from a greater distance. This relation is very important because it is what we must expect if we view associations through a range of distances, some associations close by and some more distant. The relation was later strongly confirmed over a much larger range in distance of the central galaxy and with larger numbers of examples in a paper by Arp in 1983. This is shown here in Figure 2-2._

_At first sight this result seems to contradict the previous result that quasars fall closer to brighter, more nearby galaxies. The key point to understand, however, is that nearby quasars are statistically close (closer, on the average, than one would expect by chance) to nearby galaxies and that more distant quasars are statistically close to more distant galaxies. But, the nearby associations can subtend a large angle on the sky and have rather large separations compared to the separations involved in more distant associations. The difficulty comes when people assume on the local hypothesis (quasars closer than their redshift distances) that all quasars are at the same distance and then try to analyze this mixture of quasars at different distances with galaxies at different distances. Naturally they get porridge. An example of this follows."_

An Example:

_"In 1980, a test analysis was made by one researcher of some quasars which had been found in sample areas of the sky by objective prism techniques. (The objective prism on a telescope enables the selection of objects which have strong emission lines in their spectrum -- the stellar images among these are mostly quasars.) These objective prism quasars were analyzed to see how close on the sky they fell to NGC galaxies. (Perhaps indicative of the fast pace at which astronomy moves, the New General Catalog of Gahxies (NGC) by Caroline and William Herschel was completed by J. L. E. Dreyer in 1888.) The NGC contains over 7000 objects, most of which are fainter objects at medium to large distances. There are no accurate magnitude limits for this Catalog and in addition an inhomogeneous selection of objects was made. But the Arp paper in 1970 showed bright quasars to be generally associated with the brightest galaxies in the sky. Why did the later paper in 1980 try to associate quasars with more distant galaxies?_

_And, should it have been such a surprise when it reported no significant associations? Perhaps there is some clue to be had in reading carefully the words of the author as he coyly 'suggests' that the 'seemingly high frequency of quasar/galaxy pairs reported, primarily by Arp' may be due to 'uncertainties' in the adopted quasar densities used and 'it is this effect that makes many astronomers skeptical about the statistical significance of Arp's configurations.'_

_The true state of affairs was illuminated a year later by the only young astronomer to have ever regularly dared to test the claims of the establishment. Jack Sulentic analyzed the quasars just discussed as having been claimed to disprove association with galaxies. He analyzed these same quasars and also additional samples, but this time with respect to the bright nearby galaxies with which they were supposed to be associated. He found consistent and significant quasar/galaxy associations in all the quasar samples! Moreover, he found the quasars associated with fainter galaxies fell closer to them on the sky as would be expected if these fainter galaxies were more distant._

_All this poses an interesting question: Why, when the establishment believes so fiercely in the different distances of galaxies (as indicated by their different redshifts), do they always insist on testing the association of galaxies and quasars by assuming that all galaxies (bright and faint) are at the same distance from us?_

_We will see this obviously incorrect assumption used again and again in attempts to disprove the association of quasars and galaxies."_
