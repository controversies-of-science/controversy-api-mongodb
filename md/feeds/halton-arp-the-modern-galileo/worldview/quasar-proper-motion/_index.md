Let's start with a mainstream text published in 2007.  Observe how the author arguing against Arp seems to make no mention of inherent redshift ...

_Cosmological Enigmas: Pulsars, Quasars and Other Deep-Space Questions_
Mark Kidger

_"The suggestion that quasars had been expelled violently from nearby galaxies could be dealt with easily: no quasars could be found that showed a blue shift in their spectrum and were thus coming toward us; unless every single quasar just happened to be expelled directly away from us (staggeringly unlikely), some of them had to show a blue shift. Similarly, astronomers looked in vain for any evidence of lateral motion; if a quasar had been expelled from a nearby galaxy at nearly the speed of light, it would be expected to move slightly in the sky, unless, of course, its movement was exactly away from us.⁴_

⁴ _Astronomers regularly detect such lateral motion when looking at radio loud quasars. If there is a jet of gas leaving the quasar, radio astronomy techniques are often able to detect clumps of material moving along the jet."_

_"While there are always uncertainties in our interpretation of astronomical data, the evidence against Arp's ideas is pretty overwhelming._

_One of the wonderful things about modern astronomy is that almost all scientific papers (and many of the actual observations) are freely available on the web -- if you really want to make up your own mind, why not see what the experts and the best data have to say?_

_- Peter Edmonds, CXC"_

In the spirit of doing our own research, a paper titled "Quasar Apparent Proper Motion Observed by Geodetic VLBI Networks" published in 2005 (two years before Mark Kidger's published text cited above) has mapped out the proper motions of quasars -- a feat which was once claimed to be impossible if quasars are at their redshift-inferred distances.

Note the second graph.  What was expected is a clear trend that with higher redshift, the proper motion should diminish to zero. What is seen instead is that quasars seem to have about similar proper motions at both low and high redshift.

Alongside efforts to demonstrate a lack of time dilation, proper motion studies are thought by some critics of the conventional interpretation for redshift to be one of the best approaches for demonstrating fatal flaws in the conventional interpretation for redshift.

However, Halton Arp has noted that telescope time which might produce evidence that is contrary to these textbook theories has been locked up for decades now.

This small sample study may be the best we have to make the case today.  Can you find others?
