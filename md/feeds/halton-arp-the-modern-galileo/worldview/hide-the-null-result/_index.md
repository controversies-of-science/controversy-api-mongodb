An absorption line is defined as _"Energy missing from the spectrum of an object in a narrow range of wavelengths, owing to absorption by the atoms of a particular element. The spectrum shows a black line where a characteristic color line would appear in case of emission of the same wavelength by the atoms."_

Arp makes a very important point in _Quasars, Redshifts and Controversies_ that a null absorption line result may go unannounced in the event that astronomers were seeking one to undercut Arp's interpretation:

_"An interesting footnote to the controversy over Markarian 205 and NGC 4319 is that a Caltech astronomer and a regularly collaborating fellow British scientist were in the favored position of regularly obtaining the biggest blocks, really enormous amounts of time, on the 5-meter telescope at Mt. Palomar. One of their favorite observing programs attempts to examine high-redshift objects close to low-redshift objects. If they detect absorption lines of the low-redshift objects in the spectra of the high-redshift objects, they announce them as proof that the high-redshift objects are the more distant. Of course, the high-redshift object could be just behind the low, or even imbedded in it, or, if it was ejected, have pulled out a plume of the low-redshift material around it. Be that as it may, when they don't find the low-redshift absorption, there is an implication that the high-redshift object is in front. (This is not ironclad, of course, because we may be looking through a 'chink' in the low-redshift object.) But in the case of NGC 4319 just discussed, the material in the galaxy is so spread around, that it would be difficult to imagine finding a column to look through that was free from low-redshift gas. So I noted quietly the information that had been leaked to me about a year before that they had looked hard for low-redshift absorption in the spectrum of Markarian 205. From the floor of the Liege meeting in 1983, I asked what they had found. They replied that they had found no absorption. What seemed to me quite devastating was that they had to publicly admit that they had not published information gained from those enormous amounts of large telescope time, that they had withheld this important scientific information apparently because it did not agree with the position to which they were committed."_

_"Quasars in Back of Galaxies?_

_Mrk 205 figures in another long standing argument about distances of quasars. It was long ago argued that since low red shift absorption lines were often seen in the spectra of high redshift quasars that the quasars had to be at great distances in back of the galaxies which were causing the absorption. Some partisans aggressively searched for absorption lines from NGC 4319 in the spectrum of the bright Mrk 205 . At first they did not find any but finally they found a weak line and announced that this proved that Mrk 205 was in back of the galaxy. But they barely mentioned that the line was about 10 times fainter than than expected. i.e. the quasar was indicated to be only 10% in back of the galaxy (Or one might say 90% in front.)_

_This illustrates of course that an object can be just in back, or even within the envelope of the low redshift absorber. The argument used to be that for quasars of different redshift closely along the same line of sight that the absorption lines were almost always from the lower redshift quasar, thus showing that the high redshift quasars were always in back of the low. But if the high redshift quasars were smaller than the low redshift ones, as indicated by local quasars, then the high redshift ones could be just in back of, or even within, the larger envelope of the low redshift quasar. Astronomers got quite carried away for a while measuring quasars with larger and larger separations along the line of sight and deriving larger and larger clouds around the quasars, or intervening in the line of sight. Amusingly they derived clouds so ridiculously large in linear dimension, if at redshift distances, that [the] research in this direction was dropped._

_Is Space Filled with Inter vening Gas Clouds?_

_The many absorption line systems seen at lower redshifts, particularly in the spectra of high redshift quasars, would naturally arise if cooler gas is ejected toward the observer from the high redshift nucleus.  We know these active nuclei intermittently eject material at about the observed velocities and this would be the expected observational consequence. The conventional picture of myriads of cool clouds filling an enormous path length from the quasar to the observer is very hard to substantiate from what we know of the composition of local space. On the other hand clouds close to the ejecting nucleus is supported by their redshift distribution. In some cases the absorption at rather large negative redshifts shows evidence of excitation due to proximity to the quasar, which would rule out its being at a much further separated, red shift distance._

_Space filled with cool gas clouds (proto galaxies) would be further ruled out because we would see them in radio (hydrogen surveys) and they would also produce too many young, star forming galaxies."_
