This debate needs to be mapped out for both sides.  Can you help?

_"Note on Periodicities in Quasar Redshifts._

_Periodicities in quasar redshifts have been found in all samples except one where the person who analyzed it truncated the sample in a particular way that removed the periodicities (see Depaquit et al. reference). Some authors have argued selection effects are responsible for the periodicities. This is clearly untrue because major emission lines can be seen with objective prism searches throughout the redshift range. Concentrations of redshifts close to z = 1 for optically selected quasars around companion galaxies and in dense groups of quasars prove that techniques of photographic discovery by ultraviolet excess are not significantly biased. Of course, quasars selected by their radio emission should not be biased in redshift at all. It is shown in Chapter 5 that all quasars tend to have certain rather discrete, permitted redshifts but that different groups have slightly different periods. It is the addition of these slightly shifted peaks from group to group which broadens the overall peaks as observed in the total quasar sample. The bottom line is that quasars have the astonishing property of occurring at certain preferred values of redshift, these values occurring with a definite period whose origin is a mystery at this moment."_
