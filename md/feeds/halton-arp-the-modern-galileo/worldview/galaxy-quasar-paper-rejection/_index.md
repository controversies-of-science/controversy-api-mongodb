An excerpt by Halton Arp from _Against the Tide - A Critical Review by Scientists of How Physics and Astronomy Get Done_

_"Scientific and Political Elites in Western Democracies by H. C. Arp_

_Over the years the evidence for non-velocity redshifts has grown enormously, both for quasars and galaxies. A number of researchers have tried to make the establishment admit the consequences of this evidence. But it has been suppressed and ignored. However, In an event of great irony, 30 years after Hoyle's talk featuring NGC 7603, two young Spanish astronomers have announced the finding of two quasar-like, much higher redshift objects imbedded in the arm which connects the low redshift galaxy to the higher redshift companion of NGC 7603. As in many past cases, this result alone should have settled instantly and finally the existance of intrinsic redshifts. Instead the paper was turned down by 'Nature' Magazine, rejected by the 'Astrophysical Journal' and only finally accepted by the European Journal 'Astronomy and Astrophysics'."_
