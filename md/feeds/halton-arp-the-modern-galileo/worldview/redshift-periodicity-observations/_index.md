_The Virtue of Heresy: Confessions of a Dissident Astronomer_
Hilton Ratcliffe (2nd Ed, 2008)

_"In May 2006, Arp, Burbidge, and Carosati submitted a paper to the European journal Astronomy & Astrophysics laying out the results of their comprehensive statistical analysis of alignments around the highly active, dual-nucleus galaxy NGC 4410 [44]. It was rejected, and the editors sent an unusually detailed rejection note to Dr. Arp. Because it so clearly revealed editorial bias against his work, he appended the note to his paper and published both together on the online scientific archive arXiv. Dr. Arp followed this with a letter of protest to the directors of A&A, and we patiently await their response._

_Dr. Arp and I had some correspondence about the NGC 4410 paper at the time, and initially I didn't get the especial significance of that particular publication. At first, it struck me as merely a statistical review of archived material, and as such, lent no more than numerical weight to the arguments that Arp and his colleagues were constantly putting forward. In the light of his protest letter to A&A, however, I decided to revisit the paper, and it's just as well I did. The saga of NGC 4410 gave me a stark reminder that there is something crucially important about redshifts and quasars that I haven't told you, and that is an unforgivable oversight on my part. I'm sorry. Let me remedy the situation immediately._

_In 1967, the Doctors Burbidge noticed something interesting: Their study of the redshifts of quasars produced a quirky statistic, that there was a particular redshift that was more popular with quasars than any other they had noticed. Quasars seemed to prefer a redshift of z = 1.95. This on its own is no more than a curiosity, and certainly not enough to prompt a rewrite of the Principia, but it got the mental juices of one K.G. Karlsson working overtime. In 1971, by which time the study of quasars and their characteristic redshifts comprised an extensive database, Karlsson had deduced that quasar redshifts are indeed quantised, and tend to have preferred values given by the simple formula (1 + z₂)/(1 + z₁) = 1.23. Have a look at a sample batch of quasars, measure their redshifts, and you will be astonished as I was to find that the values fall invariably into the series z = 0.061, 0.30, 0.60, 0.91, 1.41, 1.96 ... n. Note that the last value shown here is as close as makes no difference to the preferred redshift discovered by the Burbidges 4 years earlier. This was a truly astounding discovery, and strems of subsequent measurements soon indisputably verified it. In March 2006, M.B. Bell and D. McDiarmid of the National Research Council of Canada published an analysis of 46,400 (that's right -- forty six thousand!) quasar redshifts from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. They conclude, 'The peak found corresponds to a redshift period of ∆z = ~0.70. Not only is a distinct power peak observed, the locations of the peaks in the redshift distributions are in agreement with the preferred redshifts predicted by the intrinsic redshift equation.

Selection Effects in the SDSS Quasar Sample: The Filter Gap Footprint

M.B. Bell, S.P. Comeau
(Submitted on 30 Nov 2009)

_"In the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasars are targeted using colors and anything that can cause the identifying characteristics of the colors to disappear can create problems in the source selection process. Quasar spectra contain strong emission lines that can seriously affect the colors in photometric systems in which the transmission characteristics vary abruptly and significantly with redshift. When a strong line crosses a gap between two filter passbands the color effects induced by the line change abruptly, and there is also a dimming in apparent brightness compared to those redshifts where the strong line is inside a filter passband where the transmission is high. The strong emission lines in quasars, combined with the varying detectability introduced by the transmission pattern of the five filters, will result in a filter-gap footprint being imprinted on the N(z) distribution, with more quasars being missed when a strong line falls in a filter gap. It is shown here that a periodicity of Δ(z) ~ 0.6 is imprinted on the redshift-number distribution by this selection effect. Because this effect cannot be rigorously corrected for, astronomers need to be aware of it in any investigation that uses the SDSS N(z) distribution. Its presence also means that the SDSS quasar data cannot be used either to confirm or to rule out the Δ(z) ~ 0.6 redshift period reported previously in other, unrelated quasar data."_
