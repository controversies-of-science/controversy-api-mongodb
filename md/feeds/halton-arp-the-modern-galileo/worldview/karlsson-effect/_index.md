_"A. The Quantization of Redshifts_

_In 1976, William Tifft of the Steward Observatory reported a long, careful series of measurements of binary galaxies. These are galaxies so close together and of such similar redshift that they are accepted as being physically associated, presumably orbiting around each other. The startling part of his report, however, was that the differences in redshift between members of these pairs of galaxies were quantized in steps of 72 km s⁻¹ [the galaxies were receding from the Earth in whole steps of velocities of 72 kms per second] ..._

_It is amazing for me to recall now the cutting jokes, the ridicule with which this result was greeted. A graduate of Harvard with a Ph.D. from Caltech, Tifft had impeccable credentials and a record of serious, careful research. Nevertheless I was treated to some lunchtime conversation at Caltech in which an influential astronomer joked (well, everyone laughed) about retroactively cancelling his degree. Tifft's home institution stood by him, however, and he has continued to produce ground-breaking research with patience and dignity._

_The initial aberrant result was well on its way to being buried, however, when a few years later a rather dramatic event occurred._

_Tifft was on sabbatical in Italy and happened to be lecturing on the quantization result when a skeptical member of the class said, 'Here is a new list of more accurate redshifts from radio measurements of hydrogen; I am sure you won't find periodicity in here.'_

_Not only did the quantization appear in this independent set of very accurate double galaxy measurements, but it was the most clear cut, obviously significant demonstration of the effect yet seen. It is perhaps not very uplifting at this point to hear about the lack of reaction of the astronomers who had made the measurements or the difficulty in getting the significance of the results recognized and discussed. It is still a subject carefully avoided. The results were later reconfirmed by some optical measures in the Southern Hemisphere and then very strongly confirmed again by the large number of accurate measures in the independent sample shown in Figure 7-3._

_Figure 7-3 presents the same data as shown in Figure 7-1 except that the bins into which the data have been divided are very much smaller. This is possible because those hydrogen measures are so accurate. We see that not only are the preponderance of companion redshifts positive, but that they are quantized in the previously predicted, and previously confirmed, values of 72 km s⁻¹._

_It would seem difficult, to put it mildly, to have an object with a redshift which is due to velocity and then to have this object simply disappear or dematerialize when it is not traveling at 72 km s⁻¹ or some multiple thereof. The quantization, in itself, therefore, establishes the existence of redshifts which are not caused by velocity."_

Trifft, himself, pointed out some of the implications of his findings and why the scientific establishment responded with such strong, visceral animosity:

William Trifft and Richard C. Thompson, _Vedic Cosmology And Astronomy_, (Delhi, India 2004), P. 158.

_"The entire set of concepts [developed in these papers] is internally self-consistent and permits predictions which the conventional view does not even suggest. The predictions made have been verified in virtually all cases and offer alternatives to some very puzzling astrophysical problems: the mass discrepancy problem for galaxies and stellar rotational peculiarities, to name two major ones. Although not discussed specifically in these papers, the origin and evolution of galaxies by collapse [of materials in space] are also untenable, as are most, of the cosmological concepts based on the 'expanding' universe. In view of all the implications which inevitably follow from the discrete red shift hypothesis, it is not surprising that the idea has met extreme resistance. Nevertheless, a set of intimately related significant correlations involving massive amounts of data exists. Showing that the discrete red shift concept is inconsistent with the expanding universe ... or quantum electrodynamics will not eliminate or explain [away] the correlations._

_Although distant galaxies are supposedly receding from one another or at different distances from the Earth, they could not be receding at only specific intervals of velocity. Cars on the highway are traveling at various velocities. If they were doing so in quantum amounts, as do galaxies, they would say be moving at ... speeds of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, etc. miles per hour or kilometers per hour and not at 15, 23, 36, 41, 58 miles or kilometers per hour and that they 'simply disapper or dematerialize, or tunnel through time when not traveling at those intervals, as the electron cannot disappear or dematerialize when at different points in the atom.  Trifft's work was added to thereafter by William Napier and his co-worker, B.N.G. Guthrie, who continued along the line where Trifft left off, according to D.F. Roscoe:_

D.F. Roscoe, "Astrophysics in the Dark: Mach's Principle Lights the Way," _Advances in Chemical Physics Modern Nonlinear Optics_, Myron W. Evans Ed., (NY 2001), pp. 301-303

_"Napier began by using Monte Carlo methods to establish [that] an essential precondition for a rigorous analysis of the type proposed was the availability of a sufficiently large sample of redshifts, each with formal accuracy better than 5 km/s; anything less would result in a real signal a [approximately] 36 km/s being washed out by measurement errors._

_Napier's co-worker, Guthrie, performed a very detailed literature search to assemble a sample of 97 redshift measurements of the required accuracy -- taking care to reject any that had been used by Trifft in any of his claims. This sample formed the backbone of subsequent Napier-Guthrie analyses ..._

_Since redshift determinations are routinely given in the solar frame of reference, this amounted to the need to correct the redshift in the sample for the Sun's motion [around] ... the galactic center. At the time, 1989, the solar vector determinations resided in a very large error box, and so Napier's analysis had a lot of slack associated with part of it. Even so, it quickly became apparent that a very strong quantization effect emerged for estimated solar vectors anywhere inside the error box ... Extensive Monte Carlo simulations give a probability of 10⁻⁸ for a signal like that ... to have arisen by chance alone [about 1 chance in a billion]._

_Subsequent to this initial publication, the satellite [spacecraft] Hipparchus, has been laundered which has resulted in very refined conventional determinations of the solar vector error box ... These [were also found to] lie wholly inside the Hipparchus error box determinations._

_This analysis has been repeated on independent (although less accurate) samples ... with similar results. Napier and Guthries' parallel analysis of claims for 72 km/s for differential redshifts between galaxies in groups has been similarly successful, and has equally bizarre implications._

_To summarize, Tifft's original claims have been strongly and independently substantiated by the Napier-Guthrie analysis; this latter analysis has appeared in the mainstream literature and stands increasingly secure as Hipparchus observations continue to tighten the solar error box. Any serious thought about these two effects soon convinces one that the implications for cosmology are profound ..."_

Not only does this quantum relationship hold for the redshift of galaxies, but was also found for quasars, to be discussed below. It is called the Karlsson Effect, named for K.G. Karlsson, who discovered it. Ratcliffe explains:

Hilton Ratcliffe, _The Static Universe: Exploding the Myth of Cosmic Expansion_ (Montreal 2010), pp. 74-78

_"If the energy levels of cosmological light are really just a function of remoteness [of bodies in distant space] given the big bang postulates, a smooth distribution of matter in the expanding universe, then we would expect that redshift values should [be] present without digital breaks. The tabulated values would appear randomly, reflecting the suggested patternless distribution of light sources in the cosmos. If, on the other hand, redshift relates somehow to the internal energy of the source ..., then we might expect something entirely different. Speculation aside, the [standard model of cosmology] does not accommodate periodic redshifts. Are they observed?_

_The Karlsson Effect refers to certain values in redshifts of cosmological objects that appear more commonly than others. Preferred values in quasar redshifts were first detected by Margaret and Geoffrey Burbidge in 1967. Four years later, K.G. Karlsson confirmed the effect and derived a formula that constrained the periodicity. That earned him the honor of having his name pinned to an observed effect that was, in the words of [Halton] Chip Arp, 'one of the truly great discoveries in cosmic physics.'_

_Three decades later, with far more comprehensive catalogues of [cosmic object] data to work from, Doctors Burbidge and Napier published a summary of the by now overwhelming evidence for redshift periodicity entitled 'The Distribution of Redshifts in New Samples of Quasi-Stellar Objects [Quasars]' ..._

_Of course there was considerable resistance to the discovery. The upholders of orthodox law in cosmology quite naturally hoped that the effect would be local only, and they might then explain the patterns of 'cosmic structure in the direction of the north galactic pole' which 'probably would have caused such effect' (these are the words of an anonymous referee rejecting the submission of my paper on anomalous redshifts) ... [Then cosmic] wide are surveys like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) soon presented ample data confirming the Karlsson effect for as far [out into the cosmos] as we are able to measure._

_In 2009, Martin Lopez-Corredoria presented a summary of quasar [quantum] anomalies ..._

_The periods do exist in the SDSS data if the base value taken is the host galaxy's redshift and not Z = 0 [redshift = 0] as used by the studies that [previously] found no unusual preferred [quantized redshift] values ..._

_John Harnett, of the University of Western Australia [also] found a distinct periodicity in redshifts of quasars ..._

_Although Harnett concludes that the periodicity is a selection effect and not some intrinsic property of the quasars themselves, it is, nevertheless, startling that quantisation of redshifts is so apparent in the data, yet pointedly ignored in the Standard model of cosmology."_

_New Scientist_, for September 16, 1971, page 612, reports the following regarding the Karlsson Effect:

_"Some astronomers have claimed that the redshifts of quasars are not uniformly spread out but instead tend to cluster about certain values. It now looks as if the workers who 'found these periodicities' were right ..._

_Dr. K.G. Karlsson, of Uppsala University, has found no less than five [quantum] peaks at particular redshifts. These critical values at which quasar redshifts congregate form a geometric series [one level double, triple, etc. that of a certain value] and it is particularly interesting that the most recently determined redshifts lie close to one or other of these peaks (Astronomy and Astrophysics, Vol. 13, p. 333)._

_Of course, one would like to know just how much these new discoveries have been influenced by the knowledge that these peaks are there ..._

_However, if Karlsson is right, and it certainly looks that way, he has found a relation between the more common quasar redshifts, particularly around [two values] ... This can only imply a link between quasars and galaxies, because objects with redshifts as low as 0.06 are galaxies, not quasars. His results suggest strongly that redshifts are an intrinsic property of quasars and do not necessarily indicate their distance from us. Moreover, in peculiar galaxies, at least the same sort of effect occurs."_

_"Evidence mounted up in measurement after measurement [of quantized redshifts], yet [denial] on the part of entrenched astronomers was resolute and inflexible. Martin Rees, who at this time directed the Institute of Theoretical Astronomy at Cambridge University, led the charge. His position was unstable! After all, his entire career in space science ahs been built upon the notion of universal expansion. He has written best-selling books on the subject. It would be totally unreasonable to expect him to recant and turn in both his doctorate and his knighthood just because his ideas were in conflict with observation. Notwithstanding his valiant efforts to contain the revolt, it soon became obvious beyond reasonable doubt that cosmological redshifts are quantized. To deny it would be akin to contesting that the sky is blue. Yet it is denied with venom. How sad for science ..."_
