THE END OF A CONTROVERSY?
Dennis W Spratley

_"As is well known, because of their large red shift values, which are assumed to be due to the cosmological expansion, QSOs are regarded by mainstream cosmologists as being very distant, it being taken for granted that they obey the Hubble Law.  The history of the discovery of QSOâ€™s (or quasars) is well known and appears in all texts on cosmology whether they are written for the professional or amateur.  The part played by dissenters like Arp is regrettably invariably omitted.  This exclusion from standard texts is not at all surprising because Arp and others have consistently asserted that matters are far more complicated than the establishment would have us believe."_

Let's create a list of quasar books (or directly related) that you'd expect to discuss Halton Arp, but instead make no mention.

Or: What about summaries that are so short that the reader will come away with the completely wrong idea?
