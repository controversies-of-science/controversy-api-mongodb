_"The young worker in gamma rays who did this ... who brought it to me to help with the publication and so forth, was finally able to publish this result after tremendous opposition.  But, he now went out of the field and has become a science writer.  There was no place for him in this field even though I thought he was one of the best ... young workers there were, there was no place for him in this field after he published this.  But it's an extremely important observational result."_

_"... In another case, the brightest quasar in the sky (3C273) was found in 1966 to be paired with one of the brightest radio galaxies in the sky (3C274) across the brightest galaxy in our Local Super Cluster. The chances were a million to one that they belonged to the Local Supercluster and that quasars were not at their redshift distances. Then this region was measured in high energy X-rays and the connection from the central low red shift galaxy to the quasar 3C273 was explicitly visible. The influential journal Nature refused to publish it although they had just published the top half of the X-ray map of the cluster. Then the gamma ray satellite came along and showed the cluster in the highest possible energy range, greater than 100 MeV. Not only was the 3C273 quasar at redshift = .158 attached to the central galaxy at z = .003 but the famous quasar 3C279 at z = .538 was also part of this high energy filament. The data was interpreted by Arp, Narlikar and Radecke as showing birth of new matter and new galaxies and the evolution of redshift from high values to low. It was published finally in Astroparticle Physics vol 6, 1997. The clear pictorial connection has been suppressed ever since and the original author of this extraodinarily important result is no longer a professional researcher._

_The above is another kind of failure of the scientific system, unfortunately more common today. The orbiting observatory had been built at great expense, reduction procedures financed, and analytical personnel salaried. When a great discovery was made it was hidden, not shown in conferences or published, because, for one reason, I believe, the team feared that they would be attacked as incompetent observers._

_Some of the orbiting instruments that made epochal breakthroughs published results but ignored their significance. I visited one director regularly pointing out the obvious discoveries. He politely nodded and then went about ignoring the crowning achievement of his project."_
