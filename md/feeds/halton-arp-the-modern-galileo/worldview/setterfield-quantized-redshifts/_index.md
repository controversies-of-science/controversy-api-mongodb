_"It is usual that such insights attract much criticism. This was also the case after 1976, when Tifft published his first results. Many investigations have been executed with the express intent to disprove Tifft. Remarkably, many ended in confirming his research results. Is the cosmological community now convinced we deal with facts here? Which means that the Big Bang model has come into big trouble. Must we think about new ideas? Let us look at recent reactions._

_1. Since 1998 we met mainly silence: If we do not mention it, it will probably and hopefully go away._

_2. Nobody tries to deny the clear results any more._

_3. If comments are being given, fear for the status of the Big Bang model is being expressed. How would an alternative look like?_

_4. For the rest most ignorant or agnostic reactions (we don't know yet, more research is necessary, maybe other explanations, etcetera)..."_

_"E. The quantized redshift_

_From 1976 onward, Tifft published several papers indicating that redshift differences between galaxies were not smooth but went in jumps, or were quantized [20]. The Coma cluster exhibited this effect in such a way that bands of redshift ran through the whole cluster [21]. Shortly after, Tifft was presented with a list of accurate redshifts using radio measurements of hydrogen. Astronomer Halton Arp reports on the outcome of Tifft’s analysis of this data set by stating: 'Not only did the quantization appear in this independent set of very accurate double galaxy measurements, but it was the most clear cut, obviously significant demonstration of the effect yet seen. ... The results were later reconfirmed by optical measures in the Southern Hemisphere ...' [22]._

_These results have important consequences. If the redshift was indeed due to galaxies racing away from each other as the Doppler shift interpretation requires, then these speeds of recession should be distributed like those of cars smoothly accelerating on a highway. That is to say, the overall redshift function should be a smooth curve. The results that Tifft had obtained indicated that the redshift went in jumps from one plateau to another like a set of steps. It was as if every car on the highway traveled only at speeds that were multiples of, say, 5 miles per hour. Acceleration would mean immediate jumps from five to ten miles per hour, then from ten to fifteen miles per hour, etc., with no apparent speeds in between. Even more puzzling was the fact that some redshift jumps actually occurred within galaxies. If the redshift was due to motion of any kind, these jumps would imply that the galaxy concerned would be tearing itself apart, and this was obviously not happening. This result alone indicates that the redshift may not be primarily due to motion. Furthermore, on either the Lemaitre or the Doppler model, it was difficult to see how any cosmological expansion of space-time or, alternatively, the recession of galaxies, could go in jumps. These results did not fit either concept at all._

_Then, in 1981, the results of an extensive redshift survey by astronomers Fisher and Tully were published. Their measurements showed no apparent quantization [23]. Three years later, in 1984, Tifft and Cocke published their analysis of the Fisher-Tully catalogue. They noted that the motion of the Solar System through space imparted a genuine Doppler shift of its own to all redshift measurements. When this Doppler shift was subtracted from the survey results, redshift quantization appeared globally across the entire sky [24]. In 1985, there was an unexpected and independent confirmation of this quantization. Sulentic and Arp used radio-telescopes to accurately measure the redshifts of over 260 galaxies from more than 80 different groups. Their work was for an entirely different purpose. But, to their surprise, as they did their analysis, a quantization of 72.4 km/s appeared in their data. This was similar to the quantizations that Tifft and Cocke had discovered. It should be noted that the measurement error was only 1/9th the size of the quantization [25, 26]._

_F. Attempting to settle the quantization issue_

_These were disturbing developments. In order to prove Tifft was wrong, Guthrie and Napier of Royal Observatory, Edinburgh, studied redshifts, using the most accurate hydrogen line redshift data. By the end of 1991 they had studied 106 spiral galaxies and detected a quantization of about 37.5 km/s, close to Tifft’s quantum multiple of 36.2 km/s [27]. By November 1992, a further 89 spiral galaxies had been examined and a quantization of 37.2 km/s was noted [28, 29]. In 1995 they submitted a paper to Astronomy and Astrophysics with the results from a further 97 spiral galaxies showing a 37.6 km/s quantization [30]. The prevailing wisdom said the quantization only appeared because of small number statistics, so the referees asked them to repeat their analysis with another set of galaxies. This Guthrie and Napier did with 117 other galaxies. The same 37.6 km/s quantization was plainly in evidence in this 1996 data set, and the referees accepted the paper [31]. A Fourier analysis of all 399 data points showed a huge spike at 37.6 km/s Statistically, the chance of this happening is about one in a million. The measurement error was about 1/10th the size of the quantization. One comment on the redshift quantization graph stated [32]: 'One can see at a glance how accurately the troughs and peaks of redshift march metronomically outward from 0 to over 2000 km/s.'_

_Meanwhile others had been at work with more distant objects. In 1992, Duari et al. examined 2164 objects with redshifts ranging out to z = 4.43 [33]. In looking for actual quantizations, their analysis did eliminate some suspected periodicities, or quantization peaks in the graph, as not statistically significant. These small peaks were simply noise in the data. There were two other peaks, however; one being 'difficult to detect visually from the histogram' [33]. The other spike in the graph was mathematically precise at a confidence interval exceeding 99% in four statistical tests. When subjected to the Comb-Template test, the period of this candidate had a quantization of ∆z = 0.0565 or 16,938 km/s. It is important to note that in the study done by Burbidge and Hewitt in 1990, quasars were preferentially distributed at six predominant redshifts. The large peak noted by Duari et al. demonstrated that this preferential distribution was indeed due to redshift quantization and was not a selection effect [34]._

_Something else also emerged from all these studies. In looking further and further out into space, it had become apparent that the actual size of the redshift quantizations were increasing with distance. Thus, redshifts near the Virgo cluster were about 37.6 km/s. Further out, in the Coma cluster they were about 72.4 km/s. Further out than this, the redshift quantization speed was larger. By the time the distance of quasars is reached, the redshift quantization is of the order of 17,000 km/s. Any explanation of the quantized redshift needed to account for this._

_G. The latest evidence_

_The outcome of the most accurate studies by Tifft indicates a possible basic redshift quantization of about ⁸/₃ = 2.667 km/s [35] with a claim by Brian Murray Lewis that the redshift measurements used had an accuracy of 0.1 km/s at a very high signal to noise ratio [36]. Tifft suggested that higher redshift quantum values may simply be multiples of this basic figure. More recently, on 5th and 7th May 2003, two articles appeared in Astrophysics authored by Morley Bell. The second Abstract read in part: 'Evidence was presented recently suggesting that [galaxy] clusters studied by the Hubble Key Project may contain quantized intrinsic redshift components that are related to those reported by Tifft. Here we report the results of a similar analysis using 55 spiral ... and 36 Type Ia supernovae galaxies. We find that even when more objects are included in the sample there is still clear evidence that the same quantized intrinsic redshifts are present ...'_

_These results are important. On the Lemaitre model, if the fabric of space is expanding, it must be expanding in jumps. This is virtually impossible. On the Doppler model, the galaxies are themselves moving away through static space-time, but in such a way that their velocities vary in fixed steps. This is unlikely. It is important to note that the quantum jumps in redshift values have been observed to go through individual galaxies [20, 21, 37]. If the redshift was due to motion, these galaxies would disrupt. Thus, the redshift can have little to do with either space-time expansion or galactic velocities through space._

_One final piece of observational evidence may help settle the matter. Tifft, Arp and others have pointed out that the quantized redshift means that the actual velocities of galaxies in clusters are very low [21, 38]. It is only at the very centers of clusters that high velocities would be expected. This was borne out by evidence mentioned at the Tucson conference on quantization in April 1996. Observations of the Virgo cluster have shown that in the innermost parts of the cluster 'deeper in the potential well, [galaxies] were moving fast enough to wash out the periodicity' [32]. Here, 'periodicity' is the quantization by another name. In other words, if galaxies have a significant velocity, it actually smears out the quantization. What we are seeing at the frontiers of the cosmos are extremely high redshifts. If these really were due to increasing speeds of expansion, we should not be seeing any quantizations in the measurements. They should be washed out. The Virgo cluster shows us this, as actual galaxy velocities in the center do smear out the redshift measurements. These results reveal that redshifts are not basically due to galaxy motion at all, but must have some other primary cause, with Doppler effects from motion merely being a secondary component."_
