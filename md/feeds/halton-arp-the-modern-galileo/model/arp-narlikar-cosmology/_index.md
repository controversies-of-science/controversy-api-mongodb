_"I think we're about ready for the theory part of it, and as I say, everybody's gonna have their own theory.  But I wanna just follow through the implications of what we've been doing so far._

_The conventional theory ..._

_The conventional theory is the Einstein field equations of General Relativity.  And really it's much more simple than it's advertised to be._

_This Tùúáùúà is just the kinetic energy and the potential energy and the momentum term -- all of the dynamical terms -- and these are all geometrical terms -- Riemannian tensors and so forth._

_The solution made in 1922 made an approximation which I think was wrong.  It assumed that the whole universe is just like our universe and particle masses were constant everywhere in the universe -- that the electrons always had the same mass, protons always had the same mass ..._

_And they then solved this equation with this approximation in it.  They got that the space -- this is the scale factor of space -- varied as the redshift.  And so this is the expanding redshift solution.  This is the Big Bang solution._

_And they predicted expanding coordinates, singularities at time = 0, and it demands that all the redshifts are velocities of recession._

_But now we've seen that that runs up against the brick wall of the fact that they're not velocities of recession -- they're intrinsic._

_So, what I'm saying is this whole approach has to be abandoned.  This whole approach has to be abandoned._

_Well, this creates a terrible sense of panic in most people because what are you gonna substitute in its place?_

_Luckily, in this case, Jayant Narlikar -- who is a student of Fred Hoyle -- and Holye and Narlikar had investigated the general solution of this equation, which was not to assume that the particle masses were constant with time in the universe.  And in that case, they got a very simple solution that the masses varied as time squared._

_In the beginning when they're first created there was zero masses, and as time went on, they communicated with more and more of the universe.  And their mass grew.  This is a Machian theory._

_And so, if the electron mass, when it makes its transition in the atom, and emits the photon, if the mass is small, the photon is weak and it's redshifted.  As the electron grows in mass, the photon which is emitted is stronger and it drops in redshift._

_So, this is a perfect explanation for what we've been seeing -- that the younger objects are high redshift._

_And the Hubble constant -- the sacred Hubble constant -- is just the inverse age of our galaxy._

_And there's a lot of things you can say about this.  It makes a link between quantum and classical mechanics because the creation of the matter is in very small particles in the quantum regime.  There's no more singularities ... And the most important point -- and this is something I want to stress for just a minute or so -- is that this is in flat-space time -- Euclidian space-time.  In other words, you don't need any of these complicated curved space time coordinates._

_And, in fact, I would argue that the conventional solution needed these to account for the incorrect treatment of the mass particles -- so that if this is a general solution, and applies throughout the whole universe, and you get a simple solution.  And you don't need these curved space-time coordinates._

_Well, if you don't need curved space-time coordinates, then what are you gonna do about gravity?  This took me a little while to sink in, but I finally faced this and it caused me to seriously consider something that Tom van Flandern's been working on ... this question of Le Sagian ... gravity._

_And I made up the following transparency to illustrate what's sort of going on here.  And that is in this variable mass theory, which we need to explain the redshifts and the quasars, and also they're starting out with low luminosities and evolving ... we do have a primary reference frame._

_In the relativistic solution, a primary reference frame is forbidden.  And yet, the common sense would tell you that if you just average over the universe you detect, that's your reference frame.  So, again, I'm borrowing from Tom van Flandern on a number of these common sense arguments here._

_There's another movement here which has been started by some other independent thinkers whom I think are thinking very well that if you take the two timescales which are necessary for our solution ... you have a universal time and a time for our own galaxy (our own clocks, and our own galaxy is born with clocks running slow, and as time goes on, clocks speed up, approach new universal time).  So, if you take this two timescale approach, then you can solve all the normal triumphs of the general relativistic equations -- perihelion of mercury, and so forth and so on -- and it all works out very well here._

_Here are some of the names associated with this alternative approach to the general relativistic approach._

_So, without going into any more detail, I would say that it looks like the observations of the quasars are requiring a more general and a more simple solution to the physical dynamical equations, replacing the general relativistic approach and accounting for all these phenomena -- both locally and cosmologically._

_... Even though the mathematics may be quite the same, because there's just a conformal transformation between them, the physical picture is completely different.  Instead of having a universe that was all born at one instant 15 billion years ago out of nothing, you have a universe that's indefinitely; it's not expanding; the Big Bang is ... passe; and you have continuous creation of new galaxies within this ... steady-state universe."_
