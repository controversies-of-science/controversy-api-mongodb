Even amongst those who have taken the time to become savvy in the various concepts, models and debates over plasma cosmology, conversations commonly reveal that there remains significant lingering confusion on how this well of ideas can be put to use to explain quasars and instrinsic redshift.

Arp hints at Wal Thornhill's preferred approach on page 195 of _Seeing Red_:

_"On the theoretical front, it has become more persuasive that particle masses determine intrinsic redshifts and that these change with cosmic age."_

The simple fact that quasars appear initially ejected at tremendous speeds, and then subsequently slow down as they transform into galaxies with much larger mass, seems to suggest that the matter starts out at very low mass.

In the pages of _Seeing Red_, the reader may encounter a number of speculations as to physical causes.  Yet, it should be clear that Arp's incredible expertise on the topic of peculiar galaxies may require synthesis with experts in a variety of other disciplines in order to set science onto a new productive path.  This is why it's such a shame that Wal never had an opportunity to meet with him.

Wal interprets the quasar redshift observations as an extremely meaningful clue for modern physics ...

_"The electrical relationship between matter and mass allows us to understand how quasars can be newborn objects that have low mass and brightness and high intrinsic redshifts. With time, their mass increases and their intrinsic redshift decreases in quantum jumps. This shows that quantum effects also occur on a galactic scale."_

The masses of the proton, neutron and electron are increasing in tiny quantum jumps, and what is remarkable is that it is evident at astrophysical scales as a decrease in the quasar's intrinsic redshift.

_"Newton himself had the sense not to propose 'the actual physics underlying the force of gravity.' All he did was to provide a mathematical expression describing the mysterious instantaneous tension between all matter in the universe. Einstein merely confused the question with his unreal notions of matter affecting empty space. On the other hand, the electrical concept of gravity deals with real-world physics. It uses the observation that matter (subatomic particles) under electrical stress exhibit different masses to draw attention to the fact that Newton’s simple law of gravity embodies electrically variable masses. In other words, in an Electric Universe we require Electrically Modified Newtonian Dynamics, or E-MOND, to embellish the usual acronym._

_This concept applied at the atomic level also provides a simple solution to the quasar redshift puzzle. Arp and others have shown that the redshift of any object is made up of an intrinsic component and a velocity component. The velocity component is the only one recognized by mainstream astronomers. The intrinsic redshift is a property of the emitting atoms in the object. It decreases with time in discrete or quantized ‘jumps.’_

_Quasars appear to be ejected, deficient in electrons, from their parent active galactic nucleus (AGN). The lightweight electrons remain tangled in the AGN plasmoid for much longer than the heavier protons and uncharged neutrons. As a result, the quasar has lower initial charge polarization compared to matter on Earth and, from the principle of E-MOND, all subatomic particles in the quasar have lower masses. Therefore, the emitting atoms also have lower masses, and their radiation has lower energy. The result is the observed intrinsic redshift of atomic emissions from quasars and their relative faintness._

_Like the atom itself, the constituents of each atom -- the protons, neutrons and electrons -- can be viewed as resonant systems of charge, capable of exchanging electromagnetic energy for quantum jumps between stable resonant states. The quantum jumps over time to lower redshift values occur as electrons from the parent galaxy’s jet arrive at the quasar and increase the quasars’ charge polarization. As its mass increases, according to E-MOND, the quasar slows from its high ejection speed at ‘birth,’ due to conservation of momentum. When the intrinsic redshift value gets down to around z = 0.3, the quasar starts to look like a small galaxy or BL Lac object and begins to fall back toward its parent, while continuing to decrease in redshift. Eventually it becomes a companion galaxy. Arp has photos and diagrams of many such family groupings. Many can be traced to three and four generations of ejecting objects."_

To truly understand Wal's physical quasar model -- and, very importantly, his motivation for proposing it -- there is no getting around the need to understand what a plasma focus is.  Eric Lerner's _The Big Bang Never Happened_ will help us with this:

_"My conflict with conventional physics started when I was an undergraduate at Columbia in the mid-sixties. Physics itself interested me, learning why things happen as they do -- mathematics was merely a tool to understand and test the underlying physical concepts. That was not the way physics was taught; instead, mathematical techniques were emphasized. This is almost exclusively what students are still tested on, and obviously what they study the most._

_I went on to graduate work in physics at the University of Maryland, intending to get a doctorate. But after a year, I left. I couldn't reconcile myself with the mathematical approach, which seemed sterile and abstract -- especially in particle physics, in which I had considered specializing._

_After leaving school in 1970 I began to work as a science writer -- first for Collier's Encyclopedia and then freelance, writing technical reports and magazine articles. This kept me in touch with the latest developments in astrophysics, controlled fusion, and particle physics, among other things; my work was an opportunity to complete my education in physics. I especially learned about plasma physics, which had not been touched on at Columbia or Maryland._

_The seventies were the heyday of the Big Bang cosmology, but I was skeptical of it and the associated developments in high-energy physics. I knew from my Columbia days that there were fundamental contradictions in particle theory which had been swept under the rug (see Chapter Eight). The Big Bang's universe, wound up in the beginning and steadily running down, seemed wildly unscientific, and I knew that its theorists had never resolved the fundamental problem of the initial source of energy. It seemed far more likely to me that the universe had always existed, its evolution accelerating over the aeons._

_I thought a great deal about problems that interested me in physics and cosmology, but I was busy earning a living. So it was not until 1981 that I actually began serious scientific research. The origin of that first project dated back to 1974, when I met Winston Bostick while we worked with a group advocating greater funds for controlled-fusion research._

_Bostick's research centered on a fusion device called the plasma focus. It was the inspiration for my first astrophysical theories. The focus -- invented independently in the early sixties by a Soviet, N. V. Filippov, and an American, Joseph Mather -- is extremely simple, in contrast to the huge and complex tokamak, a large magnetic device that has long dominated fusion research. The focus consisted of two conducting copper cylinders, several centimeters across, nested inside each other (Fig. 6.12). When a large current is discharged across the cylinder, a remarkable sequence of events ensues._

_The current rapidly ionizes the plasma and forms into eight or ten pairs of force-free filaments, each a millimeter in diameter, which roll down the cylinder, propelled by the interaction of their currents with the background magnetic field. When they reach the end of the cylinder, they fountain inward (Fig. 6.13a). Each pair, consisting of two vortices rotating in opposite direc- tions, annihilate each other, leaving only one survivor to carry the entire current. This survivor pinches itself off into a doughnut-shaped filamentary knot -- a plasmoid (Fig. 6.13b)._

_The plasmoid, only a half-millimeter across, now contains all the energy stored in the magnetic field of the entire device -- a million or more times bigger in volume. For a fraction of a micro-second, as the plasmoid continues to pinch itself, it remains stable. But as its magnetic field increases, the electrons orbit in smaller circles, giving off radiation of a higher frequency. Because plasma tends to be opaque to low-frequency radiation and transparent to high-frequency, the radiation suddenly begins to escape._

_This sets in motion a second series of events. As the electrons radiate their energy away, the current drops and the magnetic field weakens. Since the electrons are traveling along magnetic-field lines, the weakening field tangles the electrons' path up as its shape changes -- causing the current to drop still further._

_The result is like turning off a switch, as in the double layers Alfven had observed. The falling magnetic field generates a huge electrical field, which shoots two high-energy beams out of the plasmoid -- the electrons in one direction, the ions in the other. The beams consist of extremely dense, helical filaments, each a micron (one ten-thousandth of a centimeter) across (Fig. 6.13c). In the course of this process some ions are heated to such high temperatures that they fuse._

_I was fascinated by the plasma focus for several reasons. For one thing, it was a promising approach to very economical fusion -- it doesn't need the huge magnets of the tokamak. But it also dramatically demonstrated plasma filaments' capacity to compress matter and energy. While at the time I wasn't aware of Alfven's extensive work, Bostick introduced me to his own ideas of how such filaments must have been relevant to galactic formation._

_A few years later, I began to think that the plasma focus provides a model for another cosmic phenomenon -- quasars. Over hundreds of thousands of years quasars radiate ten thousand times more energy than an average galaxy of a hundred billion stars, yet appear to be no more than a light-year or so across, compared with a galaxy's hundred thousand light-years. Their power density (power per cubic light-year) is a million trillion times larger than that of a galaxy._

_How can such a small object generate so much energy? Conventional wisdom claims that a black hole is at work, but, among other objections, there are cogent reasons to think that any object massive enough to power a quasar will break apart before it collapses into a black hole. In any case, new observations had raised another mystery._

_Beginning in 1978 high-resolution radio maps revealed that a radio galaxy's nucleus emits narrow beams of energy which connect them to outlying radio lobes. Then in 1980 a huge new radio telescope -- the Very Large Array (VLA), consisting of twenty-seven dish antennae spread over miles of New Mexico desert -- revealed to observers that the same jets emanate from the hearts of quasars._

_It occurred to me that a plasma focus and a quasar are two processes, wildly different in scale, but identical in form and dynamics. Both consist of an extremely dense source of energy that emits diametrically opposed jets giving off high-frequency radiation. A plasma focus can increase the power density of its emissions by a factor of ten thousand trillion over that of the incoming energy -- comparable to the ratio of a quasar to a galaxy._

_But how can a galaxy generate an electrical current? I knew about disk generators and calculated that a galaxy rotating in a magnetic field will generate a current flowing toward its center sufficient to power vast plasmoids -- a process Alfven had proposed four years earlier, I later found out. Since the currents must flow out along the axis, they will arc around, as in the plasma focus -- a similar geometry leads to plasmoid formation in both cases._

_While these ideas were crystallizing I was also studying the evidence, accumulating since 1978, for the existence of filament-like superclusters of galaxies. I had seen Peebles's 'Cosmic Tapestry' poster, showing the galaxies strung along lacy threads. Why couldn't these filaments of galaxies be larger versions of the filaments in the plasma focus and the filaments that I hypothesized to form in galaxies? They would produce magnetic fields in which galaxies, as they rotate, would produce the plasmoids that make up quasars or active galactic nuclei."_

_"The argument goes like this: a quasar is ejected from a galactic nucleus by the plasma focus effect as an electron-deficient plasmoid (electrons are trapped in the focus longer than the much heavier protons). Now, the phenomenon of mass is due to the energy conserving elastic response of charged particles to external electric forces. If gravity is an electric force, inertial and gravitational mass will always be identical. So, because the electric polarization of stars in the quasar is low at first, the mass of protons and neutrons will be lower than in the parent galaxy._

_Consequently electron orbits within quasar atoms will have lower energy -- light from them will be redshifted. Luminosity will also be lower due to the lack of charge-carrying electrons. Electrons streaming after the quasar create an x-ray jet and vast radio-lobes. Such electron jets are seen clearly in images from the orbiting Chandra X-Ray telescope._

_As electrons arrive at the quasar, the luminosity increases at first and mass and redshift undergo quantum jumps to new resonant states across the quasar or galaxy."_

One important consequence to Wal's approach is that it can explain the lower energy of supernovae in high-redshift galaxies without any need to invoke dark energy.

Wal also points to the importance of the observation that intrinsic redshifts occur galaxy-wide.  This shows us that there exists a near-instantaneous connection which is electrical in nature that can span entire galaxies.  We've dramatically underestimated the true reach of the electrical force at the subatomic level.
