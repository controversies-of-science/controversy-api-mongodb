Preferred Values of Redshift

_"This observed property of quasars having certain preferred redshifts has an extraordinary history and followed a typical course in the field. Geoffrey Burbidge noticed early in the measurements of quasar redshifts that too many redshifts occurred too close to the value z = 1.95. He argued vigorously for the reality of the effect but others put emphasis on the quasars of other redshifts which were observed and ridiculed the effect. There was a sort of heroic underground of analysis of quasar periodicities starting with Burbidge and Burbidge in 1967 and continued by a number of astronomers, particularly Karlsson in 1971, 1973, and 1977, Bamothy and Bamothy in 1976, and Depaquit, Peeker, and Vigier in 1984. They all more or less agreed if you looked at all quasars known, that preferred values of redshift were apparent."_

_"Note on Periodicities in Quasar Redshifts._

_Periodicities in quasar redshifts have been found in all samples except one where the person who analyzed it truncated the sample in a particular way that removed the periodicities (see Depaquit et al. reference). Some authors have argued selection effects are responsible for the periodicities. This is clearly untrue because major emission lines can be seen with objective prism searches throughout the redshift range. Concentrations of redshifts close to z = 1 for optically selected quasars around companion galaxies and in dense groups of quasars prove that techniques of photographic discovery by ultraviolet excess are not significantly biased. Of course, quasars selected by their radio emission should not be biased in redshift at all. It is shown in Chapter 5 that all quasars tend to have certain rather discrete, permitted redshifts but that different groups have slightly different periods. It is the addition of these slightly shifted peaks from group to group which broadens the overall peaks as observed in the total quasar sample. The bottom line is that quasars have the astonishing property of occurring at certain preferred values of redshift, these values occurring with a definite period whose origin is a mystery at this moment._

_The crucial discovery of periodicities in quasar redshifts was made by K. G. Karlsson. That discovery was that the redshift peaks fit a formula A log (1 + z) = const. As Table 2 in the preceding text shows, the observed redshift peaks for the average of all quasars fit the formula with const. = 0.089. Individual physical groups of quasars have slightly different constants (see Arp, review paper presented at JAU Symposium 124, Beijing, China, August 1986). Unfortunately, a possibility of which all young astronomers are aware occurred in the Karlsson case. This creative researcher was not employed in astronomy and subsequently went into medical science."_
