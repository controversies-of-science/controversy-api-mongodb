Further boltsering arguments that we should be systematically tracking "settled science" claims, the unsourced author of these various articles appear in all cases unaware that the "unexpected configuration" is expected if dwarf galaxies are to be explained as paired axial ejections from the host.

What I am unsure of is if the inferred rotation of the entire group is perhaps misconstrued from the inherent non-velocity redshift component (?).

The most remarkable aspect of these articles is the apparent fact that none of the journalists appear aware of the confirmation.  Both articles are fairly similar.  I'm including the text of both for future historical reference, for when the pages eventually go down (as all pages eventually do) ...

Mysterious dance of dwarf galaxies may force a cosmic rethink
July 21, 2014

_"The discovery that many small galaxies throughout the universe do not 'swarm' around larger ones like bees do but 'dance' in orderly disc-shaped orbits is a challenge to our understanding of how the universe formed and evolved._

_The finding, by an international team of astronomers, including Professor Geraint Lewis from the University of Sydney's School of Physics, is announced today in Nature._

_'Early in 2013 we announced our startling discovery that half of the dwarf galaxies surrounding the Andromeda Galaxy are orbiting it in an immense plane' said Professor Lewis. 'This plane is more than a million light years in diameter, but is very thin, with a width of only 300,000 light years.'_

_The universe contains billions of galaxies. Some, such as the Milky Way, are immense, containing hundreds of billions of stars. Most galaxies, however, are dwarfs, much smaller and with only a few billion stars._

_For decades astronomers have used computer models to predict how these dwarf galaxies should orbit large galaxies. They had always found that they should be scattered randomly._

_'Our Andromeda discovery did not agree with expectations, and we felt compelled to explore if it was true of other galaxies throughout the universe,' said Professor Lewis._

_Using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, a remarkable resource of colour images and 3-D maps covering more than a third of the sky, the researchers dissected the properties of thousands of nearby galaxies._

_'We were surprised to find that a large proportion of pairs of satellite galaxies have oppositely directed velocities if they are situated on opposite sides of their giant galaxy hosts,' said lead author Neil Ibata of the Lycée International in Strasbourg, France._

_'Everywhere we looked we saw this strangely coherent coordinated motion of dwarf galaxies. From this we can extrapolate that these circular planes of dancing dwarfs are universal, seen in about 50 percent of galaxies,' said Professor Geraint Lewis._

_'This is a big problem that contradicts our standard cosmological models. It challenges our understanding of how the universe works including the nature of dark matter.'_

_The researchers believe the answer may be hidden in some currently unknown physical process that governs how gas flows in the universe, although, as yet, there is no obvious mechanism that can guide dwarf galaxies into narrow planes._

_Some experts, however, have made more radical suggestions, including bending and twisting the laws of gravity and motion. 'Throwing out seemingly established laws of physics is unpalatable,' said Professor Lewis, 'but if our observations of nature are pointing us in this direction, we have to keep an open mind. That's what science is all about.'"_

Solar-System-Like Dwarf Galaxies Orbiting Andromeda -- "Point to Something Profound" (Today's Most Popular)
February 24, 2016

_"'It’s a very unusual, unexpected configuration,' says astrophysicist Dr. Julio Navarro, at the University of Victoria, an expert in evolution of galaxies and galaxy clusters and the structure and evolution of their dark matter component. 'It’s so unexpected that we don’t know yet what it’s telling us. The fact that it is there at all is pointing us toward something profound. Somehow, they have a plane-like structure similar to a solar system, but with a completely different origin and we don’t know what that origin is,' Navarro said. Understanding how and why the dwarf galaxies form the ring around Andromeda is expected to offer new information on the formation of all galaxies. Twelve of the 13 dwarf galaxies -- they range in size from 10 million to 100 million stars -- are on one side of the orbital plane, as if they are held by a string being swung from Andromeda._

_'This looks like they are all moving together and they all know where to go, like some pre-existing structure has been sucked in by Andromeda,' Navarro said. The image at the top of the page shows a stream of stars from one of Andromeda's satellite galaxies, a dwarf galaxy called Andromeda II, which is less than one percent of the size of the Milky Way detected by researchers at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen._

_The fascinating discovery about dwarf galaxies orbiting the Andromeda suggests that conventional ideas regarding the formation of galaxies like our own Milky Way are missing something fundamental. The string of 13 dwarf galaxies in orbit around the massive galaxy Andromeda are spread across a flat plane more than one million light years wide and only 30,000 light years thick, moving in synchronicity with one another, according to Navarro, one of the co-authors of an article on the phenomenon in the journal Nature. The dwarfs are spread across a distance so vast that they have yet to complete a single orbit._

_The behavior of Andromeda's dwarfs is so extreme from the usual chaotic orbits of galaxies around each other that the the researchers believe they have revealed a huge hole in science’s understanding of galaxy formation. Computer models show that the dwarf galaxies should orbit independently, almost randomly. But the structure of the synchronous galaxies orbiting Andromeda is much more like a mature solar system._

_In the paper published in the journal Nature, the international team of astronomers described the discovery that almost half of the 30 dwarf galaxies orbiting Andromeda do so in an enormous plane more than a million light years in diameter, but only 30,000 light years thick. The findings defied scientists’ expectation -- based on two decades of computer modeling -- that satellite galaxies would orbit in independent, seemingly random patterns. Instead, many of these dwarf galaxies seem to share a common orbit, an observation that currently has no explanation._

_'Astronomers have been observing Andromeda since Persian astronomers first noted it over a thousand years ago, but it is only in the past decade that we have truly studied it in exquisite detail with the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey,' said Geraint Lewis from the University of Sydney's School of Physics. 'The Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey -- cutely called PAndAS -- is a large project that ran between 2008 and 2011, using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope situated on the Mauna Kea volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii. Now that we're examining the data it collected, it is providing our first panoramic view of our closest large companion in the cosmos,' explained Lewis._

_'When we looked at the dwarf galaxies surrounding Andromeda, we expected to find them buzzing around randomly, like angry bees around a hive. Instead, we've found that half of Andromeda's satellites are orbiting together in an immense plane, which is more than a million light years in diameter but only 30,000 light years thick. These dwarf galaxies have formed a ring around Andromeda. This was completely unexpected -- the chance of this happening randomly is next to nothing. It really is just weird,' Lewis added._

_'Stars in a dwarf galaxy often move around at random, but this is not exactly the case for Andromeda II. In particular we could see that a stream of stars is moving around differently than the rest in a very coherent way. These stars are situated in an almost complete ring and are rotating around the center of the galaxy,' says astrophysicist Nicola C. Amorisco, Dark Cosmology Centre, Niels Bohr Institute. Amorisco says this kind of merger between small galaxies is bizarre at this point in the galaxy formation process and was until now an unseen event._

_Large galaxies, like Andromeda and our own Milky Way, have long been known to be orbited by an entourage of smaller galaxies. These small galaxies, which are individually anywhere from ten to at least hundreds of thousands of times fainter than their bright hosts, were thought to trace a path around the big galaxy that was independent of every other dwarf galaxy. For several decades, astronomers have used computer models to predict how dwarf galaxies should orbit large galaxies, and every time they found that dwarfs should be scattered randomly over the sky. Never, in these synthetic universes, did they see dwarfs arranged in a plane like that observed around Andromeda._

_'Now that we've found that the majority of these dwarf galaxies orbit in a disc around the giant galaxy Andromeda, it looks like there must be something about how these galaxies formed or subsequently evolved that has led them to trace out this peculiar coherent structure,' said Lewis. 'Dwarf galaxies are the most numerous galaxy type in the universe, so understanding why and how they form this disc around the giant galaxy is expected to shed new light on the formation of galaxies of all masses.'_

_There have been similar claims of an extensive plane of dwarf galaxies about our own Milky Way Galaxy, with some claiming that the existence of such strange structures points to a failing in our understanding of the fundamental nature of the Universe. 'We don't yet know where this is pointing us, but it surely is very exciting,' said Dr Rodrigo Ibata, from the Observatoire astronomique de Strasbourg, in France, and lead author on the report._
