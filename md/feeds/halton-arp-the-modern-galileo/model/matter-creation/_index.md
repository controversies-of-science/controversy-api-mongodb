In reading Halton Arp's works, it would be easy to come away with the false notion that Arp is arguing for the creation of matter from nothing (akin to the Big Bang).  The language he uses seems to suggest it, but it's not actually the case.

_Seeing Red: Redshifts, Cosmology and Academic Science_ (p. 109):

_"ÂŠit would not strictly be new creation but merely materialization of mass-energy from a different, perhaps diffuse location."_
