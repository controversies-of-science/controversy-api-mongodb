When discussing this topic of active galactic nuclei (AGN), we'd be wise to take care to distinguish between mass and matter.  Matter is the substance and mass is the property (which Arp seems to show can change over time).  The AGN appears to be recycling matter into a form which has very low mass -- in light of its high redshift and extreme ejection velocity.  When we are confronted with explaining this situation, we should arguably consider whether or not our conventional Einsteinian approach to mass is more of a hindrance than a help.

Are we looking at new, disruptive physics here?  Do those older theoretical ideas merely distract us from following the observations where they might naturally lead us -- to a new framework which is finally free of the contradictions between the small and large scales?

Think about those questions as you read Arp's explanation ...

_"5. Are proto Clusters of Galaxies Ejected like quasars?_

_If we accept that both quasars and galaxy clusters have their origin in ejections from low redshift galaxies we must face the question of what is their relation to each other. We start with the question of what gives the quasars their intrinsic redshifts. Here we invoke the variable mass hypothesis of Narlikar (1977) and Narlikar and Arp (1993). In that solution of the general relativistic field equations the particle masses of new matter start out at or near zero mass and grow with time. Because the electrons making orbital transitions in radiating atoms are initially small the emitted photons are initially redshifted and decrease their intrinsic redshift with time. The quasars are then viewed as being composed of young matter which evolves toward normal matter and normal galaxies with time._

_In the initially ejected proto quasars the particles grow in mass and slow down in order to conserve momentum so the particles cool and increasingly gravitate toward a young galaxy (no dark matter needed). The initial plasmoid, however, has low mass ions which have large cross sections and are more strongly frozen in by magnetic fields (Arp 1963). In order to have the time to evolve intrinsic redshifts into the range of older galaxies like our own they must be slowed down or stopped by the passage through the internal regions of the parent galaxies or meeting clouds in the medium exterior to the galaxy. They should be fragile and observations suggest that some quasars are split into two’s or three’s (Arp and Russell 2001, p548; Arp 1999). In practice it is suggested that sometimes they can run into a medium of cloudlets and be divided into many small proto galaxies. i.e. a cluster of proto galaxies on its way to evolving into a cluster of galaxies._

_It is worth noting that active galaxies, quasars and clusters of galaxies are the three principle kinds of extra galactic X-ray sources that exist. In the above picture each are subunits of the former. The processes in galaxy nuclei which give rise to the quasars furnish the energy to fission or explode some quasars into smaller pieces which evolve into galaxy clusters particularly in interaction with a galaxy/extra galactic environment. An example of a group of X-ray quasars which should evolve into a galaxy cluster are those roughly aligned across 3C345 (Arp 1997)."_
