The Hidden Battle over Low Mass Electron-Positron States

_"(Or, how communication is science is less than ideal.) Physicists stick to the many decimal point facts of their laboratories. They also tend to be alpha males who relegate astronomers to be laborers in the fields. Astronomers for the most part are careful to bring back attractive fruit. But it is always been my unstated opinion that Astronomy, covering such a much vaster volume of space and time, really had the ultimate advantage in dealing with fundamental physics. (and I mean that in a deeper, more general and encompassing sense)._

_At any rate, again decades ago, I gave a lecture to the astronomers at Cornell about my observational findings. At the end Carl Sagan stood up and said, 'Well I have heard of people who did not believe in religion and other things, but you don’t believe in anything!' Everyone had a good natured laugh and as we filed out Tommy Gold took me aside and said, 'We cannot have low mass electrons floating around in the universe because we would detect them in our laboratories.' The best answer I could give was, 'All the particles in our galaxy would be the same age so I would expect very few intergalactic ones.' And added, 'Also perhaps we have detected some, but have not realized it'._

_Imagine my reaction when reading a book review in Physics Today I caught a glimpse of the words 'low mass electrons'. It turned out to be 'Selectivity and Discord' a book by Allan Franklin⁷ about controversial experiments some of which were ultimately accepted and some of which were rejected. The introduction to the chapter on low mass electron-positron states read: '... the earliest results were all thought to be in sufficient agreement to support the existence of the electron-positron states ... Eventually the results were shown to be incorrect. The consensus is that there are no low mass electron-positron states.' Franklin shows enough of the observed peaks observed in high energy heavy element collisons in accelerators to indicate the strength of the evidence. Some of them fit ratios of quasar redshift peaks. I can only remark that low mass electrons from nearby galaxies or quasars would be expected to show peaks at certain preferred values. Low mass electrons from higher redshift objects would have displaced peaks. In addition, this younger material is ejected intermittently in different directions from notoriously variable centers. I wonder why it was not possible just to say we do not have an explanation for these laboratory observations but perhaps it will become clearer as time goes on. Somehow I am reminded of the remark that some scientists would rather be wrong than uncertain. It seemed like a rather bitter controversy with damage done to some participants._

_I am also bemused by the fact that neither I nor my astronomical colleagues knew about this rather hot conflict. At this point we might recall history and ask: Why are scientists such reluctant Copernicans? The problem seems to be about approval and fear of disapproval, jockeying for power and position. One thing sems observationally clear, lasting changes come slowly."_

An excerpt from ...

_Selectivity and Discord: Two Problems of Experiment_
Allan Franklin

(this is a lengthy and highly technical discussion that's packed with data; I've provided a few pages just to provide the gist of it)

_"Chapter 5: Are There Really Low-Mass Electron-Positron States?_

_In the chapters on gravity waves and on the 17-keV neutrino, we saw that selectivity can be a cause of discordant experimental results. This was also the case in the recent controversy concerning the possible existence of low-mass electron-positron states produced in high-energy heavy ion-atom collisions. In this episode, we see selectivity applied to both data and to the procedures used to analyze that data. This episode is more complex than those discussed earlier because it includes results that could be replicated only some of the time and experiments performed under seemingly identical conditions that gave different results. The questions of what constitutes an adequate replication of an experiment and what are the 'same' results was extremely important. In addition, even though there were problems with replicating them, the earliest results were all thought to be in sufficient agreement to support the existence of the electron-positron states, or at least to merit further investigation. The discord was recognized only later. Eventually the original results were shown to be incorrect: The consensus is that there are no low-mass electron-positron states._

_Here I brietly outline the history. Early experiments found evidence that positrons with discrete energies, or positron lines, were produced in high-energy heavy ion-atom collisions. Later experiments also detected an electron produced in coincidence with the positron and found peaks in the sum-energy spectrum (Eₑ₊ + Eₑ₋), suggestive evidence for low-mass electron-positron states or particles.¹ Because the effects appeared for various pairs of projectiles and target nuclei, as well as in three different experimental apparatuses, the results had credibility, although there were some problems concerning their reproducibility. This credibility led others to further investigate the phenomena. The later experiments produced conflicting claims. Part of the difficulty in attempting to resolve this issue was that the results were not reproducible. Even when later experiments were done under very similar conditions to the original experiments, the effects did not always appear, and when they did, the results were not always identical. The failure to reproduce the effects cast doubt on the original results._

_A recent analysis by Ganz and the EPOS II (Electron POsitron Solenoidal spectrometer) group (Ganz et al., 1996) has suggested that the observed effects might be artifacts created by the selection criteria used to produce the experimental result.² Applying certain selection cuts to one half of his data and tuning the cuts to produce a maximal effect, Ganz and company found rather strong evidence (a five-standard-deviation effect) for a low-mass state. Applying identical cuts to the other half of his data showed no such evidence.³ This failure cast doubt on the positive result and also on the analysis procedures initially used. The originally observed effect was five standard deviations above background. If the observation is a real effect, then it is very improbable that it would disappear in the analysis of the other half of the data. The implication is that the effect is an artifact created by the cuts. Although most physicists working in the field believe that the proposed low-mass electron positron states do not exist, not everyone agrees (see Taubes, 1997; and note 12)._

_This episode nicely raises the question of whether particular experimental cuts or selection criteria can create an effect that is not really present. I examine how the physicists involved dealt with this issue and with the associated problem of discordant experimental results. The situation is made more difficult by the fact that the heavy ion-atom systems under investigation contain a large number of particles with many possible interactions. That one may study these reactions as a function of no fewer than fourteen different variables further increases the difficulty of the experiment. On the theoretical side, the situation was made difficult because (1) the heavy ion-atom systems being studied are quite complex; and (2) positrons may be created both by electromagnetic processes in the strong electric fields produced in heavy ion-atom collisions and by nuclear interactions._

_Positron Line Spectra_

_The history of possible low-mass electron-positron states began with the demonstration that positrons were indeed produced in high-energy heavy ion-atom collisions (Backe et al., 1978; Kozhuharov et al., 1979). The motivation for these experiments was the theoretical speculation that positrons would be produced in the strong electric fields produced by such collisions. The positrons were expected to be produced in supercritical systems, those for which the binding energy of the lowest energy state is greater than 2mₑc², where mₑ is the mass of the electron. This is true for heavy ion-atom systems that have a total nuclear charge Zᵤ > 173. These early experiments, all performed at the heavy-ion accelerator at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionforschung (GSI), Darmstadt, Germany, showed a surprising enhancement of positron production at energies < 400 keY. They were followed by more detailed experiments, which produced unexpected results on the basis of accepted theory. The early experimental results illustrate quite clearly the problems of reproducibility and sensitivity of experimental results to both the selection criteria and the experimental conditions. These would be continuing problems in the subsequent history._

_The three early experiments -- performed by the EPOS I, TORI, and the Orange groups -- used two different methods for high-efficiency positron detection. Subsequently, no questions were raised concerning the adequacy of the different detectors. Everyone agreed that they were good positron detectors and that they had been carefully calibrated._

_One of the intriguing new results found by the EPOS I group was the measurement for ²³⁸U + ²³⁸U at E(²³⁸U) = 5.9 MeV/u (u is one atomic mass unit) (Bokemeyer et al., 1983), shown in Figure 5.1. The lower graph shows the positron energy spectrum for the angular region 11° ⩽ |Δ𝛉| = |𝛉₁-𝛉₂| ⩽ 19° and 89.2° ⩽ ∑𝛉 = 𝛉₁+𝛉₂ ⩽ 89.8°, where 𝛉₁ and 𝛉₂ are the scattering angles of the projectile ion and the target atom, respectively. Two peak-like structures are seen at positron energies of approximately 320 keV and 590 keV. The peaks do not appear in the upper graph, which is the positron energy spectrum for 25° ⩽ |Δ𝛉| ⩽ 35° under otherwise identical conditions. The EPOS I experimenters were aware of the problems of both reproducibility and selectivity. In discussing the significance of their results, Bokemeyer and company (1983) stated:_

_'However, before drawing any far reaching conclusions from the experimental data presented, we feel that the following questions should be solved. First of all one must show by further analysis that the structures are not produced by some yet unknown background effects associated with one of the event selecting criteria. Secondly, the reproducibility of the effect has to be shown. (p. 290, emphasis added)'_

_The problem of reproducibility mentioned was not merely methodological and abstract. It appeared quite dramatically in the results presented by the ORANGE group (Kienle, 1983). They found peak-like structures appearing at positron energies of 370 keV and possibly at 720 keV and 950 keV. The structures appeared most strongly only for certain scattering angles, an effect similar to that seen by EPOS I. The energy of the lowest peak differs from that of EPOS I by approximately 50 keV and the 590 keV peak seen by the latter is not visible at all in the ORANGE results. The peaks at 720 keV and 950 keV observed by the ORANGE group were not seen by EPOS I; nor were they seen when the ORANGE group repeated their experiments._

_An excess of positrons produced at low energy reported by the TORI group at the same time suffered from the same problem (Backe et al., 1983a). The question of the sensitivity of the observed results to the experimental conditions and what constitutes an adequate replication had appeared (Greenberg, 1983):_

_'However, it is again disconcerting to find that the inconsistency observed for some of the measurements reported by Kienle is repeated here. A subsequent experiment was not able to reproduce the deviations from theory found in the initial data on the U + U system. This begins to suggest that controlling the bombarding conditions carefully may be a crucial ingredient in studying these effects. As I noted already, the underlying reason for this sensitivity is presently not understood, unfortunately. (p. 883)'_

_Despite the problems he had noted, Greenberg's summary of the experimental situation at a 1981 conference was quite positive:_

_'Thus, these last experiments, like the others we have discussed, suggest very convincingly that there are excess positrons above the dynamically induced background, but they go even further in pointing out that the additional positrons are associated with selected kinematic conditions possibly reflecting a focused nuclear reaction. (p. 886)'_

_Unfortunately, theory did not provide either suggestions or justification for what those conditions and associated selection criteria should be, further complicating the problem. Experimental work continued, but the uncertainty remained. For example, the EPOS I group reported a 316-keV positron line produced in U + Cm collisions (Greenberg and Greiner, 1982; Schweppe et al., 1983). Unfortunately, the group using the TORI spectrometer concluded that  for the same reaction 'no statistically significant structures have been observed in this experiment' (Backe et al., 1983b, p. 1840)._

_The existence of a peak near 300 keV was further supported by the ORANGE group (Clemente et at., 1984). However, the position and strength of this and other observed peaks are sensitive to the bombarding energy and the heavy-ion scattering angle, as shown in Figure 5.2. Further work by both EPOS I and ORANGE groups achieved, at least, internal consistency. The EPOS I group observed peaks in the Th + Th, Th + U, U + U, Th + Cm, and U + Cm systems (Cowan et al., l985). Their average value for the peak energy was 336 keV. Similar consistency was found by the ORANGE group for the U + U and U + Th systems. Their peak energy was, however, approximately 280 keV. Under virtually identical conditions, different results had been obtained._

_Both groups agreed that neither nuclear transitions nor spontaneous positron emission could be the cause of the positron lines. One could salvage spontaneous positron emission as a cause of the observed positron lines, but only by invoking changes in the charge configuration and the ionization states for the compound system that were regarded as physically unrealistic. Both groups suggested that the constant energy peak might have a common -- and different -- source: 'An obvious speculation is that the source of the monoenergetic positrons is the two-body decay of a previously undetected particle' (Cowan et al., 1985, p. 1764, emphasis added)._

_Everyone -- experimentalists and theorists alike -- agreed that 'a clear signal for a neutral particle could be provided by the detection of amonoenergetic electron in coincidence with the peak positrons' (Cowan et al., 1985, p.1764)._

_Electron-Positron States_

_The EPOS I group reported a possible low-mass neutral particle (Cowan et al., 1986). This paper illustrated the dependence of the observed effects on selection criteria or cuts, discussed earlier in this chapter. In this experiment, the EPOS I spectrometer had been modified so that both electrons and positrons could be observed in coincidence and their respective energies measured. Striking effects appeared, but only under certain circumstances. Figure 5.3a shows the intensity distribution for all coincidence events as a function of the kinetic energies of the positron and of the electron, Eₑ₊ and Eₑ₋, respectively, for U + Th collisions at 5.83 MeV/u. Parts b and c of the figure show the projections of the distribution onto the Eₑ₊ and Eₑ₋ axes, respectively. No structure is apparent. The curves shown are the result of a Monte Carlo calculation that included both nuclear and atomic processes. It is a good fit to the spectra._

_When cuts were made on the data, however, structures did appear. Figure 5.4a shows the positron energy spectrum obtained when the energy of the coincident electron was restricted to the range 340 < Eₑ₋ < 420 keV. Figure 5.4b shows the complementary distribution for electron energy when the positron energy was restricted to the same region. Both graphs show peaks at approximately 380 keV, with widths of approximately 80 keV, indicating that a significant fraction of the coincident events had electrons and positrons with the same energy. The experimenters noted that the observed effect was six standard deviations above background.⁴ (Equal energies are what one would expect if both particles resulted from the decay of a slowly moving particle.) This peak, although similar to those previously reported, is, in fact, different from them. EPOS I had previously found a positron peak at approximately 336 keV and the ORANG£ group had found a peak at approximately 280 keV._

_Figure 5.4c shows the number of events as a function of the sum of the electron and positron energies, Eₑ₋ + Eₑ₊. The experimenters required Eₑ₋ ≈ Eₑ₊, which, when combined with the kinematic broadening of the energies, resulted in cut C (the wedge cut in Figure 5.3a). 'The resulting sum-energy spectrum contains a narrow peak, at a mean energy of 760 ± 20 keV, with 35.3 ± 9.4 events in excess of the fitted continuous background' (Cowan et al ., 1986, p. 446). Figure 5.4d is the intensity of events as a function of the energy difference Eₑ₊ - Eₑ₋, requiring that Eₑ₊ + Eₑ₋ be constant (cut D in Figure 5.3a). A peak is also seen at Eₑ₊ - Eₑ₋ ≈ 0._

_None of these structures appeared in any of the projections for the energy regions adjacent to cuts A-D on either side (Figure 5.4e-h). They were quite sensitive to the energy cut. The authors were able to fit a Monte Carlo calculation to the observed peaks by assuming that neutral particle with mass 1.8 MeV was produced in the collisions (Figure 5.4i-l)._

_The EPOS I group had found that a significant fraction of the electrons and positrons from coincident electron-positron pairs had approximately the same energy and were given off at large angles (~180°) to one another. This was compatible with the view that they were the result of the decay of a low-mass particle, produced at very low velocity in the center-of-mass frame of reference. They concluded that 'Features associated with the electron-positron decay of a slowly moving neutral particle appear to be retlected in the observations involving electron-positron coincidences' (Cowan et al., 1986, p. 447). The EPOS I group presented new results in June 1986 (Cowan et al., 1987). This paper included a history of the positron lines to that time, details of the modified EPOS spectrometer, the results on the low-mass electron-positron states previously presented by the group, and a detailed discussion of new results. The sensitivity of the experimental results to experimental conditions and selection cuts was made even more apparent in this paper._

_The most striking new result was evidence for two additional low-mass electron-positron states at sum energies Eₑ₊ + Eₑ₋ of 620 keV and 810 keV. As was the case with the previously reported 760-keV state, the effects did not appear in all of the data: Observing them required selectivity. Figure 5.5 shows the new results. The original figure caption read, 'Results of a preliminary analysis of U + Th collisions near 5.87 MeV/u (Feb 1986). (Eₑ₊ + Eₑ₋) and (Eₑ₊ - Eₑ₋) projections for two subsets of data gated on beam energy, heavy-ion scattering angle and e⁺ or e⁻ TOF [time of flight] chosen to enhance the prominent lines at ~810 keV and ~620 KeV, respectively' (Cowan et al., 1987, p. 117, emphasis added). The data in Figure 5.5a,b (the 810-keV state) were obtained with beam energy 5.87-5.90 MeV/u and TOF difference between the heavy-ion signal and the electron and positron signals set for 'prompt' events (prompt events are those expected from the decay of a single particle). The data in Figure 5.5c,d (the 620-keV state) had beam energy 5.85-5.90 MeV/u, with the electron TOF set for prompt electrons with the positron TOF delayed by an average of 3 ns. The sensitivity to cuts is clear: Only one state appears in each set of graphs.⁵ The peaks were sensitive both to the bombarding energy and TOF._

_The sensitivity of the observed effect to the TOF cut had been found empirically. The TOF cut was applied because another result had been seen earlier at one time delay but not at others. No theory at the time predicted any sensitivity to the TOF of the electrons and positrons. There were other such effects. Some effects were seen only in data taken with a 'fresh' target. Figure 5.6b shows a positron line observed only with data taken in the first hour of heavy-ion irradiation of the target. Figure 5.6a, the total data sample for the run, shows no such effect._

_This illustrates and emphasizes the problem of cuts. In studying a rare and previously unobserved phenomenon, one may very well have to apply cuts to see any effect at all. One might ask: Is the observed effect real or an artifact of the cuts? Is the experimenter tuning the cuts to create the effect? Is the sensitivity of the result to beam energy due to a real resonance phenomenon, as some physicists suggested, or is it only a statistical effect enhanced by the cut on beam energy? Similar questions arise for the TOF and target exposure cuts._

_Although the experimental results were compatible with the production of a new particle, no theory or model could actually explain the results. Despite the theoretical difficulties, the experimental results on the positron lines and the possible low-mass electron-positron states were sufficiently credible that other experimenters searched for similar effects in other interactions in which such effects might be expected to appear. All but one of these searches was negative. No trace of a new particle was seen in radiative upsilon decay, electron bremsstrahlung, nuclear decays, muon or pion decay, or hadronic showers._

_The only positive result reported in these searches was that of a suggestive peak in the sum-energy spectrum for electrons and positrons produced in e⁺ + thorium collisions (Erb et. al., 1986). The experimenters were quite positive about the previously reported positron lines:_

_'The peaks observed in the energy spectra from heavy-ion collisions raise a variety of important questions. Established beyond any doubt by a series of heavy-ion experiments their properties are puzzling and their existence appears to be unexplainable in terms of conventional or atomic phenomena. (p. 52)_

_They concluded:_

_The width and energy of the peak structure in our data is similar to that found in the heavy-ion data (their sum-energy peak was at 670 keV, in contrast to the peaks found at 620 keV, 760 keV, and 810 KeV by the EPOS group, leading to the speculation that both may reflect a common underlying process. (p. 56)_

_The subsequent history of this puticular effect is a microcosm of the entire episode. Attempted replications of the experiment gave positive, negative, and inconclusive results ..._

_Notes:_

_1. As we shall see, these peaks appeared only when certain cuts were applied. In particular, the electrons and positrons were required to have approximately equal energies and to be emitted back to back, exactly what one would expect if they were the decay products of a single state or particle._

_2. The EPOS I group was one of those that reported the original effect. The I and II refer to different versions of the experimental apparatus. The membership of the group also changed._

_3. Ganz divided his data set into two subsets by using a random-number generator on an event-by-event basis. This guarded against any systematic effects that varied with time._

_4. The question of how one should properly estimate such statistical confidence levels when cuts are applied subsequently became an issue. The probability of a six-standard deviation statistical effect is 2.0 X 10⁻⁹._

_5. The signal could also be enhanced relative to the background by making cuts on the heavy-ion scattering angles. See Figure 3 and figure 32 in Cowan et al. (1987) and their discussion on pp. 185-86 ..."_

Be aware that Arp tries to extend these 1.23 conjectures to planetary orbits; if this interests you, I recommend purchasing the text ...

_Seeing Red: Redshifts, Cosmology and Academic Science_
Halton Arp

_"The factor of redshift quantization for the quasars is 1.23 as in:_

_(1 + Z𝓃)/(1 + Zo) = (1.23)ⁿ_

_which gives:_

_z₁ = .06_
_z₂ = .30_
_z₃ = .60_
_z₄ = .96_
_z₅ = 1.41_
_z₆ = 1.96_
_z₇ = 2.64_
_z₈ = (3.47)_

_These peaks are observationally so well established that it has always been a great frustration for me not to be able to use the factor 1.23 in the 72 km/sec quantization which is observed for the galaxies, namely:_

_z = 72, 144, 216, 288 etc._

_For example (1 + z₁)/1.23 yields a large negative redshift, not 72 km/sec = .00024. So just out of curiosity I calculated what the power of 1.23 should be in order to give a redshift of 72 km/sec:_

_1 + ⁷²/𝑐 = 1.00024 = (1.23)ª_

_It turned out that the value of a = .0011592. (Details of this development can be found in Apeiron, vol.2, no. 2, p.43, April 95.)_

_Because I had been exploring the spin of the electron as a possible basic time unit, I was in a position to notice the extraordinary coincidence of this power, a, with the numbers in the value measured for the magnetic moment of the electron (which is ¹/₂ the Lande g splitting factor):_

_ᵍ/₂ = 1.00115965 = 1 + 𝛼/2𝜋_
_a = .001164[4]_
_𝛼/2𝜋 = .00116141_

_where a is now the power to which 1.229 must be raised (1.229 is the most [accurate] the quasar redshift can be measured). 𝛼/2𝜋 is the fine structure constant that determines the line spacing in atomic spectra. Considering the difficulty of picking five correct numbers in a row (like a lottery) -- there seems to be something significant here. But so far it is not a solution, but only a clue which connects the quasar redshift spacing with atoms in quantized states._

_In an attempt to make some sense of this I tried to visualize an electron with its spin interacting with the magnetic field of the nucleus of its atom. Depending on its spin orientation, it can assume a series of quantized, fine structure energy levels. At an earlier time the electron wants to be at a lower mass (because of m varying as t²). But its least change is the lowest permitted quantum step so that when it does notch lower, it forms an electron which is less massive by (1.229)⁻⁰⁰¹¹⁶⁴ than at our epoch. Then any atomic transition, emitting or absorbing a line, will be redshifted by 72 km/sec relative to our terrestrial standards. The second notch down will give + 144 km/sec, then 216 etc. as observed in our Local Group companion galaxies which are of the order of 10⁷ years younger than our parent galaxy M31._

_Taking into account the interaction of the elementary particle with the surrounding electromagnetic field is the domain of quantum electrodynamics and the language becomes very specialized. Phenomenologically, we can say that the increase of the intrinsic redshift in quasars as we consider younger matter seems to come from the lower particle (electron) masses. In the other direction, as the matter ages, the quasars show that their electrons do not increase in mass smoothly but rather in quantized steps of a factor of 1.23. The evidence from the smaller intrinsic redshift steps indicates that there is a fine structure between these large steps -- that the redshift drops in smaller quantized steps, but probably spending the most time in the strong resonances of the 1.23 factors. But what the factor 1.23 represents, or where it comes from, is very difficult to say at the moment. Perhaps we need more empirical clues."_
