Halton Arp Intrinsic Redshift

https://youtu.be/EckBfKPAGNM?t=3243

_"It relies on the fact that we live in a hierarchical universe.  And this is kind of interesting, because if you start in the galaxy nucleus, you get a high density.  These are all just rough estimates on my part._

_In the center of this active nucleus -- this mysterious engine where the stuff is created (and we can maybe talk about that informally) -- that density is very high._

_So, the new particles are in that environment and they're gaining mass from their environment very rapidly.  When they step out of the nucleus, they go into a different, much lower density environment into the bulge of the galaxy._

_And then if they come out in the plane, they go out here.  If they come out along the axis, they drop down here._

_These are enormous drops in density, from five of them in the log -- or something like that._

_And then finally, when they break out of the local group, they take another step down, and out of the local supercluster they take another drop down._

_This means that these particle masses will be gaining mass very rapidly, and the redshift will be dropping very rapidly on one of these steps.  And then it levels off, and it does another step, and then drops._

_And there are just about 1-2-3-4-5-6 drops, and there are six major quantization levels, so what we're suggesting is that maybe this redshift quantization that we're seeing in the quasars is a reflection of the density hierarchy in the whole universe._

_And of course it's an unbounded universe.  We don't know what's going on out there."_
