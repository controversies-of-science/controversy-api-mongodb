_Gravitational Lensing: An Astrophysical Tool_

_"1.3 Models_

_The small number of observables in lensing means that the observational data, no matter how accurate, can be fit by a huge variety of lens models. The space of allowed models must be narrowed by the adoption of priors which reflect our understanding of the relative astrophysical plausibility of different mass models."_

Challenge: Can you list out and explain the techniques available to astronomers to validate that a lens is real?
