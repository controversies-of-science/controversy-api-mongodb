It has been claimed that transverse redshift factor is sometimes used as justification to avoid performing detailed proper motion studies of quasars.  This is an obscure Relativity equation.

Can somebody point to an example that supports this claim?  Can you define the term, as well as the phenomenon's empirical support?
