But prolonged observation and analysis using radio telescopes have revealed that these jets appear to be ejecting material at several times the speed of light!  The image to the right was provided courtesy of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory / Associated Universities, Inc. (NRAO/AUI) which operates the VLBA and other radio telescopes.   It is a time-lapsed mosaic of 3C 279 and a stream of material that has been ejected from its core.  As indicated by the markings along the axis the bright blob of material at the end of the stream traveled roughly 25 light-years over a period of only 7 years.  This would place the velocity of the stream at approximately 3.6 times the speed of light!  There have even been jets of material observed in 3C 273 that appear to be traveling at almost ten times the speed of light!  How can this be possible when the speed of light cannot be broken?  The latest and most accepted explanation proffered by scientists is that these superluminal velocities are merely optical illusions.  These illusions are supposedly generated by relativistic effects caused by the jets traveling very close to the speed of light and at very small angles to the line-of-sight of the observer.  However, the length and collimated nature of the jets preclude the possibility that we just happen to be observing both quasars with their jets pointed almost directly at us.  Therefore relativistic effects, if they even do exist, would not be the cause of these observations.</em></p>"},{"id":"10-times-quasar-superluminal-motion-paragraph-12","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","superluminal quasar motions","3c273","3c279","3c278","ngc4783","3c275","quasar flares","halton arp's website","virgo cluster","relativity"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/10-times-quasar-superluminal-motion/large.jpg","width":2048,"height":2048},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/10-times-quasar-superluminal-motion/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/10-times-quasar-superluminal-motion/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":2,"TileSize":512}},"postParagraph":"<p><em>This leaves only two other possibilities.  Either the laws of physics have been broken and the speed of light has been exceeded by several-fold, or the quasars simply aren’t as far away as most astronomers believe them to be.   The latter possibility is at least testable using simple mathematics.  For example, if 3C 279 was actually located less than 2 billion light-years from Earth, instead of the almost 7 billion as generally believed, the superluminal velocities of its jet would be reduced to subluminal speeds due to reduction in scale.  Similarly, reducing the distances for all of the aforementioned quasars greatly reduces the overall expected scale of the surrounding gamma ray bridge and required power output of the encompassed quasars.  But changing the accepted distances calls into question the accuracy of distance measurements based on redshifts believed to be caused by universal expansion.   And of course calling universal expansion into question calls the Big Bang Theory into question, and thus the controversy.\"</em></p>"},{"id":"10-times-quasar-superluminal-motion-paragraph-13","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","superluminal quasar motions","3c273","3c279","3c278","ngc4783","3c275","quasar flares","halton arp's website","virgo cluster","relativity"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/10-times-quasar-superluminal-motion/large.jpg","width":2048,"height":2048},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/10-times-quasar-superluminal-motion/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/10-times-quasar-superluminal-motion/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":2,"TileSize":512}},"postParagraph":"<p><em>Bye Bye Big Bang: Hello Reality</em> (2002)\nWilliam C.

For most astronomers, previous spectroscopic observations taken with the telescope in 1991 had just about settled the case. Those observations showed the galaxy absorbed light from the quasar (in other words, there was a series of dark absorption lines in the spectrum of the quasar that were caused by light from the quasar being absorbed by cool gas in the galaxy’s spiral arms). Knacke’s images of the pair were the best ever, with a resolution many times better than the original ones published by Arp in 1971. The results were spectacular. Markarian 205 lies in a quite normal galaxy with a hint of spiral arms. The brightness of the galaxy is consistent with its distance calculated from the red shift. There is also a much fainter and less well known companion of Markarian 205 clearly shown in the Hubble images that is another compact but much fainter galaxy at the same red shift as Markarian 205. This forms a genuine pairing with only a small separation in space.</em></p>"},{"id":"a-peculiar-disproof-paragraph-8","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","mark205","ngc4319","hubble space telescope","bridge"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/a-peculiar-disproof/large.jpg","width":2048,"height":2048},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/a-peculiar-disproof/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/a-peculiar-disproof/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":3,"TileSize":512}},"postParagraph":"<p><em>These images have not closed the issue of the luminous connection between quasar and galaxy; however, they have greatly reduced its importance.

Most scientists suspect it is a random wisp of structure in one or the other of the two galaxies, although there is no really clear explanation.

As usual, however, it was excoriated in private. One of the major techniques for dismissing such results was introduced about this time. The catch-phrase is known as 'a posteriori statistics.' Normal people may not find that so catchy. But the idea is rather simple: After any event has happened, the probability of it happening in that precise way can always be computed to be vanishingly small. For example, if two people are photographed in the streets of a city of one million inhabitants, we would say that the chance of A being directly adjacent to B is one in a million. But in any random street scene there are perforce many A's next to unrelated B's. This is all quite evident from common sense. But what is also quite evident from common sense is, that if we continue to get photographs at different times and places of A next to B, we had better conclude some relationship exists between A and B. So far as the charge of 'a posteriori statistics' which has been levelled at each new piece of quasar evidence is concerned, the association of quasars with galaxies was demonstrated in 1966. Each succeeding example has therefore been an additional confirmation of an 'a priori' prediction. The dismissal of each of these on a case-by-case basis with the excuse of 'a posteriori statistics' has been, at best, poor science and, at worst, a tactic of evasion.\"</em></p>"},{"id":"arp-bayes-theorem-paragraph-3","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","quasars, redshifts and controversies","a posteriori","bayes' theorem","statistics"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/arp-bayes-theorem/large.jpg","width":2048,"height":2048},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/arp-bayes-theorem/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/arp-bayes-theorem/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":2,"TileSize":512}},"postParagraph":"<p><a href=\"http://electric-cosmos.org/Bayes.pdf\">http://electric-cosmos.org/Bayes.pdf</a></p>"},{"id":"arp-bayes-theorem-paragraph-4","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","quasars, redshifts and controversies","a posteriori","bayes' theorem","statistics"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/arp-bayes-theorem/large.jpg","width":2048,"height":2048},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/arp-bayes-theorem/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/arp-bayes-theorem/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":2,"TileSize":512}},"postParagraph":"<p>Statistics - Tool or Weapon?</p>"},{"id":"arp-bayes-theorem-paragraph-5","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","quasars, redshifts and controversies","a posteriori","bayes' theorem","statistics"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/arp-bayes-theorem/large.jpg","width":2048,"height":2048},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/arp-bayes-theorem/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/arp-bayes-theorem/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":2,"TileSize":512}},"postParagraph":"<p><em>\"The application and misapplication of Bayes’ theorem</em></p>"},{"id":"arp-bayes-theorem-paragraph-6","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","quasars, redshifts and controversies","a posteriori","bayes' theorem","statistics"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/arp-bayes-theorem/large.jpg","width":2048,"height":2048},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/arp-bayes-theorem/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/arp-bayes-theorem/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":2,"TileSize":512}},"postParagraph":"<p><em>There is an old saying: 'Statistics don't lie... but statisticians sometimes do.'

So far as the charge of 'a posteriori statistics' which has been levelled at each new piece of quasar evidence is concerned, the association of quasars with galaxies was demonstrated in 1966. Each succeeding example has therefore been an additional confirmation of an 'a priori' prediction. The dismissal of each of these on a case-by-case basis with the excuse of ' posteriori statistics' has been, at best, poor science and, at worst, a tactic of evasion.</em></p>"},{"id":"arp-statistics-battle-paragraph-9","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","statistics","quasars, redshifts and controversies","a posteriori"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/arp-statistics-battle/large.jpg","width":3072,"height":3072},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/arp-statistics-battle/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/arp-statistics-battle/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":6,"TileSize":256}},"postParagraph":"<p><em>G.

In order to eliminate what seemed to be the inescapably small probability of chance occurrence originally obtained, one claimed that part was due to a large factor of error due to one cause and the other a large factor of error from another cause -- neither had to make a formal calculation from the actual data.</em></p>"},{"id":"arp-statistics-battle-paragraph-28","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","statistics","quasars, redshifts and controversies","a posteriori"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/arp-statistics-battle/large.jpg","width":3072,"height":3072},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/arp-statistics-battle/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/arp-statistics-battle/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":6,"TileSize":256}},"postParagraph":"<p><em>An extensive recalculation on these data was later made by two other authors, E.

With essentially the same precepts as the earlier authors, they found instead an association of quasars with the galaxies with an overall chance of only about 1 in 100 of being accidental. The reason that this still fell short of my original improbability is that they also ignored the fact that the galaxies with which the quasars are associated have varying distances from us. The absolutely key point is that my original calculation used a simple way of taking into account the different distances from us of the galaxies around which the quasars were found. To ignore this elementary piece of astronomy in which everyone believes leads to a strong dilution of the effect by looking in areas where quasars are not expected to be found and ignoring areas where they are. The nub of the matter is the following: When testing the null hypothesis, the assumption that the quasars are not associated, the last two authors find evidence for association. The burning question then becomes, why not test the hypothesis that they are associated, taking into account the varying distance of the galaxies? Why not repeat the test which gave the original, overwhelmingly significant association with the galaxies?</em></p>"},{"id":"arp-statistics-battle-paragraph-29","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","statistics","quasars, redshifts and controversies","a posteriori"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/arp-statistics-battle/large.jpg","width":3072,"height":3072},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/arp-statistics-battle/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/arp-statistics-battle/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":6,"TileSize":256}},"postParagraph":"<p><em>Of course, when two sides differ so sharply over calculations performed on the same data, one side must be wrong.

The average background density of quasars could not conceivably contribute significantly to the observed numbers in the small area on the sky in which these quasars were found. In fact, the density of quasars at these radial distances from their associated galaxies (in this investigation the investigated galaxies were all companion galaxies to larger galaxies) exceeded by more than 20 times the measured density of these kinds of quasars away from such galaxies. This result appears in Figure 2-5, where the error bars on the determinations from quasars of various apparent brightness class are also shown. All three magnitude classes of quasars agree that the excess density around these galaxies must be, taking a liberal estimate of the possible background density of quasars, between 10 and 30 times that background density. This is the same result that was the conclusion of the first, much maligned paper.

among radio sources that were identified with visible objects, an even more mysterious class than radio galaxies was found. These were the quasars. Optically they looked like point sources of light -- like stars -- hence their name 'quasi-stellar' radio source, a term soon shortened to quasar. The first of these objects was identified by Allan Sandage and Thomas Matthews in 1963 in a collaboration between an optical and a radio astronomer. Then Maarten Schmidt, an astronomer at Caltech, found the key to the spectrum by showing the initially puzzling lines were those of familiar elements but shifted very far to the red. This was the shock. Why, when the highest redshifted galaxies known had maximum redshifts of 20 to 40 percent the velocity of light, did these stellar-looking objects suddenly appear with redshifts of 80 or 90 percent the velocity of light? It was briefly considered whether some other mechanism than velocity of recession could be responsible for quasar redshifts. For example, redshifting (which is equivalently a loss of energy of a photon) might by caused by a very strong gravitational field. Such explanations were quickly discarded, however, and it was decided that quasars were the most luminous objects in the universe, seen at such great distances that the expansion of the universe was giving them the largest possible recession velocities.</em></p>"},{"id":"early-quasar-history-immediate-difficulties-paragraph-2","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","quasars, redshifts and controversies"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/early-quasar-history-immediate-difficulties/large.jpg","width":2048,"height":2048},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/early-quasar-history-immediate-difficulties/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/early-quasar-history-immediate-difficulties/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":2,"TileSize":512}},"postParagraph":"<p><em>Difficulties were encountered almost immediately. In the first place, how could an object be so luminous? There was a problem of creating so much energy from known kinds of galaxies. Then, the calculated density of charged particles was so high in some quasars, that there was a problem of actually getting the photons, by which we see the objects, out from the interior. Then, very accurate positional measures by radio telescopes (very long base-line interferometry) revealed the astounding fact that some quasars appeared to be expanding with up to ten times the velocity of light. This was a flat-out violation of the known law of Einsteinian physics that the speed of light is a physical constant that cannot be exceeded in nature. Rather than move the quasars to lesser distances, which would give quite modest expansion velocities, the conventional theorists set up a small industry for rationalizations. They explained, by extremely complicated models, the faster-than-light expansions as an illusion caused by very special, assumed conditions such as ejection toward the observer at nearly the speed of light. They, of course, ignored the direct evidence that the quasars were associated with galaxies which were much closer to us in space.</em></p>"},{"id":"early-quasar-history-immediate-difficulties-paragraph-3","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","quasars, redshifts and controversies"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/early-quasar-history-immediate-difficulties/large.jpg","width":2048,"height":2048},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/early-quasar-history-immediate-difficulties/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/early-quasar-history-immediate-difficulties/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":2,"TileSize":512}},"postParagraph":"<p><em>When enough quasars were identified over the sky it became clear that anomalies also existed in the increase of their numbers with apparent faintness.

This gave rise to another 'gee whiz, isn't the universe wonderful' explanation. In this case, it was concluded that as we look out in space, and therefore back in time, we encounter a higher and higher density of quasars until suddenly -- at a certain point -- the quasars ceased to exist! In the present book, however, I do not debate whether this peculiar evolution of quasars is a priori improbable.

One example of such a paper is Howard Yee’s (1988) analysis which computed a required mass of about 100 billion suns inside the very small radius where the quasars are located. This leads to a mass to light ratio (M/L) of about 13 which Yee states '...is near the high end of that of large spiral galaxies ... but is entirely acceptable.' Well not quite. If you consult the original reference (Kormendy 1988), you see that this M/L is completely above the bulges for spiral galaxies, even above that for E galaxies and that is for a lower limit on the required M/L. In fact if you extrapolate the luminosity required for an elliptical to have this M/L ratio it comes out MB = -25 mag. How bright is -25 mag.? Well conventional quasars start at MB = -23 mag. so this galaxy would have to be 2 magnitudes brighter than the supposed brightest objects in the universe, a conventional quasar!</em></p>"},{"id":"einstein-rings-expectations-vs-observations-paragraph-18","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","gravitational lensing","seyfert galaxies","seeing red","einstein cross","einstein rings","peer review","mass-to-light ratio","ngc3079","ngc3628"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/einstein-rings-expectations-vs-observations/large.jpg","width":1500,"height":1500},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/einstein-rings-expectations-vs-observations/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/einstein-rings-expectations-vs-observations/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":5,"TileSize":256}},"postParagraph":"<p><em>In a later paper, Rix, Schneider and Bahcall (1992) in a computation essentially no different from Yee’s derive the same mass for the galaxy. Their contribution was to change 'entirely acceptable' to 'lens models ... explain the wealth of observations elegantly.' Actually this so-called confirmation rests on the assumptions that the redshift dispersions in galaxy interiors represent both velocities and velocities in equilibrium. As we have seen the observations show this is incorrect on both counts and systematically overestimates the masses of galaxies. Furthermore the mass needed for lensing is underestimated by assuming it is all concentrated at a point in the center of the galaxy -- hence the lower limit mentioned above. Also in the matter of the Cross a disk galaxy is called an elliptical and mass-to-light ratio comparisons are shuffled between blue, visual and red.

The A object is the bluest object in our whole survey, which is a fortuitous thing, I suppose. My proposal to Kitt Peak was joint with Bob Carswell, with whom I had been working since the earliest days of the spectral work. On our first clear night, we quickly got onto this object. Figure 5(a) shows the first spectrum ever obtained for 0957+561A. It was taken on 29 March 1979 with the IIDS. Anyone familiar with the instrument will know that this was taken at the telescope: we've still got the instrumental profile, which gives the overall shape. After 20 minutes, there are two strong broad emission lines, which were clearly carbon IV and carbon III at redshift 1.4. We couldn't reduce the data fully at the telescope, but the redshift was clearly approximately 1.4. Fine, we had a QSO. Then we moved on to object B. Figure 5(b) is a spectrum of object B obtained a few minutes later. There are two strong emission lines, the same two emission lines. Same redshift. Clearly, we'd made a mistake and had set on the same object twice. So we went back and made sure. We went back and forth a few times before we were quite certain that these two objects had the same redshift. We did all kinds of tests for light scattering and seeing. There was no contamination of one spectrum by the other. We had two QSO's with the same redshift. We got very excited and thought about this. We did not think right away that it was a gravitational lens. Anybody now finding two objects at similar redshift calls it a gravitational lens, but you didn't do it so readily in those days ...</em></p>"},{"id":"first-lens-claim-paragraph-4","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","gravitational lensing","0957+561"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/first-lens-claim/large.jpg","width":2048,"height":2048},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/first-lens-claim/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/first-lens-claim/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":3,"TileSize":512}},"postParagraph":"<p><em>This was the first time that a close pair of QSO's had redshifts so close to each other.

A 1 percent probability may sound small, but play often enough and that 1 percent probability will come up in the end, so scientists will usually say that something that has a probability of 99 percent is only barely significant.\"</em></p>"},{"id":"galaxy-quasar-association-statistics-paragraph-5","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","statistics","quasars, redshifts and controversies"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/galaxy-quasar-association-statistics/large.jpg","width":1536,"height":1536},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/galaxy-quasar-association-statistics/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/galaxy-quasar-association-statistics/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":3,"TileSize":256}},"postParagraph":"<p><em>Quasars, Redshifts and Controversies</em>\nHalton Arp (1987)</p>"},{"id":"galaxy-quasar-association-statistics-paragraph-6","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","statistics","quasars, redshifts and controversies"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/galaxy-quasar-association-statistics/large.jpg","width":1536,"height":1536},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/galaxy-quasar-association-statistics/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/galaxy-quasar-association-statistics/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":3,"TileSize":256}},"postParagraph":"<p><em>\"To summarize this initial chapter, I would emphasize that with the known densities with which quasars of different apparent brightness are distributed over the sky, one can compute what are the chances of finding by accident a quasar at a certain distance from a galaxy (see Appendix to this chapter).

One much quoted value comes from the Braccesi field (Braccesi, Formiggini, and Gandolfi 1970; Formiggini et al. 1980). As discussed by Woltjer and Setti (1982), the field yields a density of quasars N(&lt;20) = 19. But the Braccesi field contains five bright (Shapley-Ames) galaxies. Three of these have 𝝂₀'s between 836 and 1042 km s⁻¹, just the distance range in which we have found quasar associations in the present paper. The galaxy with 𝝂₀ = 836 km s⁻¹, NGC 4861, falls only 20' south of the border of the Braccesi restricted field from which is derived the density N(&lt;20) quoted above. Quasar density enhancements have been shown around the companion galaxies in the present paper by a factor of 20. Around the galaxy NGC 1097, density enhancements of about 8 are encountered out to distances of excess of 10 arcminutes on the sky (Wolstencroft et al. 1982) as well as density enhancements within a 4 deg² area around NGC 1097 (Arp, Wolstencroft, and He, in preparation). Correction downward in numbers to allow for bright galaxies in the Braccesi field might actually bring that quasar density below the density indicated in Figure 22.</em></p>"},{"id":"galaxy-quasar-association-statistics-paragraph-48","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","statistics","quasars, redshifts and controversies"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/galaxy-quasar-association-statistics/large.jpg","width":1536,"height":1536},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/galaxy-quasar-association-statistics/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/galaxy-quasar-association-statistics/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":3,"TileSize":256}},"postParagraph":"<p><em>Another case where quasar density has been taken from an area of probable quasar concentration and attributed to general background density is from the 4 m transmission grating prism survey of Osmer (1980).

As emphasized earlier in this paper, a certain percentage of objects appear stellar and have UV excesses like broad line quasars but nevertheless yield relatively narrow-line, low-redshift spectra when observed spectroscopically. This tendency appears to increase toward fainter magnitudes. Some very faint examples were encountered in the present paper. In this regard it is interesting to note that Kron, Koo, and Windhorst report (Koo 1982) that of 26 objects of appropriate colors to be quasars at B ~ 22±0.5, nine have narrow emission lines and only nine of the remaining have broad quasar emission lines.

It seems best to leave these objects in both the background density counts and the counts in the vicinity of nearby galaxies and companions. There are transition spectra which bridge the gap between normal broad-line quasars and narrow-line galaxies, so the objects are implied to be physically related.

He has written some of the classic papers, and has been a leader in the subject for more than 25 years. All I can offer is an external perspective on gravitational lensing, emphasizing its actual and potential impact on other topics in astrophysics. Gravitational lensing enables us to probe the distribution of all gravitating matter (including the often-dominant dark matter), in galaxies, clusters, and superclusters. Lensing allows us to probe the structure of quasars, with an angular resolution better than a micro-arcsecond, and to see magnified images of faint remote galaxies lying behind clusters. Lensing offers also a diagnostic of the nature of the dark matter, particularly if it consists of discrete compact objects; it also offers new tests of cosmological models, and an independent method of determining Hubble's constant. And finally, lensing may reveal new exotic types of object, such as cosmic strings.</em></p>"},{"id":"gravitational-lensing-origin-paragraph-4","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","gravitational lensing","quasars"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/gravitational-lensing-origin/large.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/gravitational-lensing-origin/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/gravitational-lensing-origin/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":3,"TileSize":256}},"postParagraph":"<p><em>General Features of Lensing by Extragalactic Objects</em></p>"},{"id":"gravitational-lensing-origin-paragraph-5","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","gravitational lensing","quasars"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/gravitational-lensing-origin/large.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/gravitational-lensing-origin/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/gravitational-lensing-origin/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":3,"TileSize":256}},"postParagraph":"<p><em>Gravitational lensing is an application of light bending, which is of course one of the classic tests of Einstein's general relativity.

For galaxies, this criterion is marginally satisfied. This means that multiple images can be expected, but the optics is more complicated than in the standard point mass case. We shall be hearing about the theory of gravitational imaging in the next talk, by Ramesh Narayan. The situation in essence resembles ray propagation through a medium whose refractive index varies from place to place. The refractive index differs from unity by a quantity 2Φ/c², where Φ is the Newtonian potential. In most applications, we have the simplification that the bending angles are small. Also, of course, lensing is an achromatic phenomenon. It is also useful to think in terms of the distortion of the wave fronts by the variable refractive index. One can then see, as later speakers will discuss more fully, how multiple images can result if the effective focal length is shorter than the distance to the source. Caustic surfaces, where pairs of images merge, play an important role in the optics; the light travel times may be different along the different paths.</em></p>"},{"id":"gravitational-lensing-origin-paragraph-15","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","gravitational lensing","quasars"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/gravitational-lensing-origin/large.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/gravitational-lensing-origin/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/gravitational-lensing-origin/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":3,"TileSize":256}},"postParagraph":"<p><em>Imaging by Galactic Potentials</em></p>"},{"id":"gravitational-lensing-origin-paragraph-16","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","gravitational lensing","quasars"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/gravitational-lensing-origin/large.jpg","width":1000,"height":1000},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/gravitational-lensing-origin/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/gravitational-lensing-origin/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":3,"TileSize":256}},"postParagraph":"<p><em>In modelling a galaxy, the gravitating effect of the dark halo must be included; as a first approximation, one might therefore consider a model for an isothermal sphere with a specific core radius. In this case, the bending angle for light rays passing outside the core is independent of impact parameter, being related to the velocity dispersion. For sufficiently close alignments, three images are seen; the central one, corresponding to light passing through the core, is very weak if the core radius is small. If we introduce the further complication of ellipticity, the image structure is more complicated. There is a range of source positions, corresponding to very close alignment with the lens, where 5 images are seen. Further out, there is an annular region where 3 images occur, rather as in the isothermal sphere, and for sufficiently large impact parameters there is of course no multiple imaging at all. It is remarkable that the known cases of lensing can be modelled satisfactorily by a spheroidal mass distribution of this kind. In particular, this model can be applied to both of the best-studied and best-established lenses.

There are 4 images, within a spacing of about 2 arcseconds, symmetrically disposed around the centre of the foreground galaxy. This system again can be fitted by an ellipsoidal mass distribution, according to which there would be a faint 5th image right at the centre. This system was discovered accidentally; and, indeed, it must be regarded as a rather improbable and fortunate accident that such a precise alignment exists with a nearby galaxy. There has consequently been scepticism in some quarters about whether it really is a lens. All that can be said in rebuttal is that it would be even more remarkable if the 4 images, all with the same redshift, existed for some other reason, in a configuration which can be so well modelled by the lensing hypothesis. The lines of sight to the images pass within the central part of the galaxy, where one would expect the dominant mass to be in the ordinary stars rather than in dark matter.

Palomar. One of their favorite observing programs attempts to examine high-redshift objects close to low-redshift objects. If they detect absorption lines of the low-redshift objects in the spectra of the high-redshift objects, they announce them as proof that the high-redshift objects are the more distant. Of course, the high-redshift object could be just behind the low, or even imbedded in it, or, if it was ejected, have pulled out a plume of the low-redshift material around it. Be that as it may, when they don't find the low-redshift absorption, there is an implication that the high-redshift object is in front. (This is not ironclad, of course, because we may be looking through a 'chink' in the low-redshift object.) But in the case of NGC 4319 just discussed, the material in the galaxy is so spread around, that it would be difficult to imagine finding a column to look through that was free from low-redshift gas. So I noted quietly the information that had been leaked to me about a year before that they had looked hard for low-redshift absorption in the spectrum of Markarian 205. From the floor of the Liege meeting in 1983, I asked what they had found. They replied that they had found no absorption. What seemed to me quite devastating was that they had to publicly admit that they had not published information gained from those enormous amounts of large telescope time, that they had withheld this important scientific information apparently because it did not agree with the position to which they were committed.\"</em></p>"},{"id":"hide-the-null-result-paragraph-3","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","absorption lines","quasars, redshifts and controversies","mark205","ngc4319","halton arp's website"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/hide-the-null-result/large.jpg","width":2048,"height":2048},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/hide-the-null-result/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/hide-the-null-result/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":3,"TileSize":512}},"postParagraph":"<p>Arp made some additional comments about absorption lines on his website, which can be retrieved with the Wayback Machine ...</p>"},{"id":"hide-the-null-result-paragraph-4","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","absorption lines","quasars, redshifts and controversies","mark205","ngc4319","halton arp's website"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/hide-the-null-result/large.jpg","width":2048,"height":2048},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/hide-the-null-result/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/hide-the-null-result/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":3,"TileSize":512}},"postParagraph":"<p><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20061109193924/http://www.haltonarp.com/?Page=Abstracts&amp;ArticleId=6\">http://web.archive.org/web/20061109193924/http://www.haltonarp.com/?Page=Abstracts&amp;ArticleId=6</a></p>"},{"id":"hide-the-null-result-paragraph-5","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","absorption lines","quasars, redshifts and controversies","mark205","ngc4319","halton arp's website"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/hide-the-null-result/large.jpg","width":2048,"height":2048},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/hide-the-null-result/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/hide-the-null-result/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":3,"TileSize":512}},"postParagraph":"<p><em>\"Quasars in Back of Galaxies?</em></p>"},{"id":"hide-the-null-result-paragraph-6","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","absorption lines","quasars, redshifts and controversies","mark205","ngc4319","halton arp's website"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/hide-the-null-result/large.jpg","width":2048,"height":2048},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/hide-the-null-result/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/hide-the-null-result/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":3,"TileSize":512}},"postParagraph":"<p><em>Mrk 205 figures in another long standing argument about distances of quasars.

Then a theoretician named Claude Canizares suggested an explanation whereby the foreground galaxy acted as a 'gravitational lens,' magnifying and displacing the apparent position of a background quasar. According to Einstein's theory, light rays passing close to a massive body will be bent by its gravity (although, as discussed later in the section on relativity, other interpretations see it as regular optical refraction). So imagine a massive foreground galaxy perfectly aligned with a distant quasar as viewed from Earth. As envisaged by the lensing explanation, light from the quasar that would otherwise pass by around the galaxy is pulled inward into a cone -- just like light passing through a convex optical lens -- and focused in our vicinity. Viewed back along the line of sight, it would be seen ideally as a magnified ring of light surrounding the galaxy. Less than ideal conditions would yield just pieces of the ring, and where these happened to be diametrically opposed they would create the illusion of two quasars straddling the intervening galaxy. In other cases, where the alignment is less than perfect, the ring becomes a segment of arc to some greater or lesser degree, offset to one side -- maybe just a point. So quasar images are found close to galaxies in the sky more often than you'd expect.</em></p>"},{"id":"hogan-and-the-graduate-paragraph-7","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","kicking the sacred cow","james hogan","hubble law","statistics","gravitational lensing","microlensing","quasar ejection","quasar-galaxy associations","telescope time","seyfert galaxies","mark205","ngc4319","peer review"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/hogan-and-the-graduate/large.jpg","width":2048,"height":2048},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/hogan-and-the-graduate/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/hogan-and-the-graduate/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":2,"TileSize":512}},"postParagraph":"<p><em>But the locations didn't match fragmented parts of rings.

Such a detail might sound trivial to the lay public, but it's the kind of thing that can have immense repercussions within specialist circles. When Arp submitted this fact to Astronomy and Astrophysics the editor refused to believe it until it was substantiated by an acknowledged lens theorist. When Arp complied with that condition, he was then challenged for his prediction as to how the counts of quasars should vary as a function of their apparent brightness. By this time Arp was becoming sure that regardless of the wrecking ball it would send through the whole cosmological edifice, the association was a real, physical one, and so the answer was pretty easy. If the quasars were associated with bright, nearby galaxies, they would be distributed in space the same way. And the fit between the curves showing quasar counts by apparent magnitude and luminous Sb spiral galaxies such as M31 and M81 -- galaxies resembling our own -- was extraordinarily close, matching even the humps and minor nonlinearities.

If the redshifts have been misunderstood, then inferred distances can be wrong by a factor of from 10 to 100, and luminosities and masses wrong by factors up to 10,000. The founding premise to an academic, political, and social institution that has stood for three generations would be not just in error but catastrophically misconceived.

Courtès, in 1961, discovered a pair of proto-spiral arms emerging, consisting of glowing gaseous matter also emitting the 'synchrotron' radiation of high-energy electrons spiraling in magnetic fields. An X-ray astronomer called Wolfgang Piestch established that the arms of gas led like rocket trails to a pair of X-ray sources coinciding perfectly with two Blue Stellar Objects. When the ritual of obstructionism to obtain the spectra of the BSOs ensued, Margaret Burbridge, a Briton with over fifty years of observational experience, bypassed the regular channels to make the measurement herself using the relatively small 3-meter reflector telescope on Mount Hamilton outside San Jose in California, and confirmed them to be quasars.

Hoyle pointed out an absolute mathematical disproof of the cosmological nature of quasars. Mathematically he showed that in order to reproduce, on the cosmological assumption, the observed numbers of quasars as a function of redshift, their luminosity function must be very steep. (That is, at a given distance, or redshift, the number of quasars must increase rapidly as their luminosity decreases.) All the conventional analyses indeed require this very steep luminosity function. Yet as Hoyle points out, the observations strongly violate this requirement. You can see a dramatic example of this in the top of Figure 5-8. Between redshifts 0.2 ≾ z ≾ 1.0 there are a number of quasars between apparent magnitude 16 ≾ V ≾ 17 mag. If the conventional luminosity function were really valid, then we should observe ten times as many quasars in the redshift interval between 18.5 ≾ V ≾ 19.5 mag.

Firstly, other photographs appeared that did not show the connecting ‘bridge’ − as it has also come to be called.  Moreover, Arp’s abilities as an observational astronomer were called into question − as they still are to this day.  This charge of incompetence persists despite the fact that other astronomers, including gifted amateurs, have photographed the ‘bridge’.  By 1973, he felt that the deteriorating situation was bad enough to merit his demonstrating that he was not an incompetent photographer.  He did so by producing and showing at a meeting held in Australia that year a short exposure of the system that did not show the ‘bridge’.  The whole point of this exercise was to demonstrate that the appearance of the faint apparently connecting material is not revealed unless the photograph is deep.  In layman’s terms this means that the images of both NGC 4319 and Mark 205 must be grossly over exposed.  In Arp’s picture of 1971, the nucleus of NGC 4319 and the image of Mark 205 can be seen to be 'burnt out'.  This technique was, of course, not new.

In addition, within the filament that extended to and ended on the QSO with red shift of 0.633 was a third QSO with red shift of 1.259.  This was in 1994.

There was also the fact that his short paper would be published.  It would not appear in a prestigious journal but in the little-read Proceedings and publication would take more than a year.  Nevertheless, it meant that those researchers with interest would find the reference and be able to access the pictures and X-ray data.  In addition, there would be other dissidents at the meeting with whom to exchange views.  Even if the establishment figures would not be particularly pleased to see him, there were two sympathetic colleagues at the symposium; in attendance was the Indian theoretician Jayant Narlikar as was the formidable, no-nonsense Geoffrey Burbidge, the latter scheduled to give what was always his latest assessment that some QSOs at least were much closer than their cosmological distances derived from their red shifts.  By now Geoffrey Burbidge once a sceptic was now a convert.  One establishment figure was the then Astronomer Royal, Professor Sir Martin Rees.  He was present to give the customary so-called defence of the Big Bang theory and assessment of the present state of knowledge, despite that fact that the vast majority of members present were establishment and - as Arp expresses matters - 'everyone knew what was going to be said'.  Such a talk would invariably last nearly an hour whereas new observations, such as those of Arp and Burbidge and which were uncomfortable for the received wisdom, either had no time at all or were confined to 15 to 20 minutes.

He began with a vigorous attack on the observations that had been shown in the short presentation given by Halton Arp earlier in the symposium.  Rees did not like them.  This is understandable; they cut across all the beliefs to which he has devoted most of his professional life.  Undeterred by the attack, when it became his turn to make an opening statement, Halton Arp gave the audience even more observational images that contradicted conventional wisdom.  At that juncture the meeting was opened up for the audience to participate in the discussion and Govert Schilling, a Dutch journalist, rose to his feet to ask a question of Martin Rees.  It was a very obvious question to ask.  Arp gives what he calls a rough paraphrasing: 'In view of the evidence Dr. Arp has shown, why have not major facilities been used to further observe these objects?'

Yet according to Halton Arp, in the early days of the HST the administrators had allocated 10% of instrument use to worthy and well-informed amateurs who were acknowledged by the professional astronomers as being important contributors to the science.  Rumour had it that a request had been made to observe Mark 205.  Arp was more than just sceptical about this circulating story.  However, several years later he was visited in his office by the author of the proposal, a competent and knowledgeable high school teacher who was able to show Arp the observations that confirmed the ‘linking’ material between NGC 4319 (low red shift) and Mark 205 (high red shift).  The teacher left, with Arp having exhorted him to publish these results but nothing ever appeared in print and Arp never saw or heard from him again.  What difficulties the amateur may have faced remain unknown.  Another amateur was allocated time for spectroscopic observations on the QSO/quasar which definitely has a luminous filament extending from it to the galaxy 1327-206.  Unfortunately, NASA 'accidentally' pointed the HST at the wrong object!  Not long after this debacle, the 10% allocation time for amateurs on the HST was suspended/cancelled.  The official reason given by the Space Telescope Allocation Committee was that it was: 'too great a strain on its expert personnel'.

Whatever the final outcome of this controversy, the whole sorry saga is a bad reflection on cosmology as has been conducted over the last forty years by those Halton Arp has dubbed 'the establishment'.\"</em></p>"},{"id":"importance-of-deep-photographs-paragraph-29","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","ngc4319","mark205","bridge","peer review","hubble space telescope"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/importance-of-deep-photographs/large.jpg","width":2048,"height":2048},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/importance-of-deep-photographs/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/importance-of-deep-photographs/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":3,"TileSize":512}},"postParagraph":"<p>References</p>"},{"id":"importance-of-deep-photographs-paragraph-30","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","ngc4319","mark205","bridge","peer review","hubble space telescope"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/importance-of-deep-photographs/large.jpg","width":2048,"height":2048},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/importance-of-deep-photographs/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/importance-of-deep-photographs/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":3,"TileSize":512}},"postParagraph":"<p>Quasars, Redshifts and Controversies by Halton C.

Palomar a luminous bridge was discovered between the low redshift galaxy NGC 4319 and the much higher redshift quasar, Markarian 205. Because this contradicted the assumption that redshift was unvariably a measure of veloeity and distance, it invalidated the hypothsesis of an expanding universe. Conventional astronomers fiercely resisted this evidence but as it accumulated for this and numerous other similar examples the results were increasingly suppressed and ignored. Flash forward to October 2002. The Space Science Telescope Institute issued a press release, with a picture of NGC 4319/Mrk 205 showing no bridge and with the imputation that it never existed. After all these years we suddenly learn there was serious evidence which has now been finally refuted. But wait a minute! The picture actually does show the bridge. If you just download the web image and increase the contrast at faint levels, there it is! Actually the NASA 'proof' picture was not even printed deeply enough to show the outer spiral arms of the galaxy! There is a narrower core to the bridge, a kind of umbilical cord which the higher resolution HST can now pick out. Many non professionals immediately produced very good pictures of the bridge from the same NASA picture. Here is shown a comparison of the press release picture and a deep print of the same picture by Jack Sulentic of the University of Alabama (JPEG image of NGC4319/Mark205 by B.

Since expansion occurs throughout the universe, it seems that time dilation should be a property of the universe that holds true everywhere, regardless of the specific object or event being observed.

Quasars seemed to prefer a redshift of z = 1.95. This on its own is no more than a curiosity, and certainly not enough to prompt a rewrite of the Principia, but it got the mental juices of one K.G. Karlsson working overtime. In 1971, by which time the study of quasars and their characteristic redshifts comprised an extensive database, Karlsson had deduced that quasar redshifts are indeed quantised, and tend to have preferred values given by the simple formula (1 + z₂)/(1 + z₁) = 1.23. Have a look at a sample batch of quasars, measure their redshifts, and you will be astonished as I was to find that the values fall invariably into the series z = 0.061, 0.30, 0.60, 0.91, 1.41, 1.96 ... n. Note that the last value shown here is as close as makes no difference to the preferred redshift discovered by the Burbidges 4 years earlier. This was a truly astounding discovery, and strems of subsequent measurements soon indisputably verified it. In March 2006, M.B. Bell and D. McDiarmid of the National Research Council of Canada published an analysis of 46,400 (that's right -- forty six thousand!) quasar redshifts from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. They conclude, 'The peak found corresponds to a redshift period of ∆z = ~0.70. Not only is a distinct power peak observed, the locations of the peaks in the redshift distributions are in agreement with the preferred redshifts predicted by the intrinsic redshift equation.

Quasar spectra contain strong emission lines that can seriously affect the colors in photometric systems in which the transmission characteristics vary abruptly and significantly with redshift. When a strong line crosses a gap between two filter passbands the color effects induced by the line change abruptly, and there is also a dimming in apparent brightness compared to those redshifts where the strong line is inside a filter passband where the transmission is high. The strong emission lines in quasars, combined with the varying detectability introduced by the transmission pattern of the five filters, will result in a filter-gap footprint being imprinted on the N(z) distribution, with more quasars being missed when a strong line falls in a filter gap. It is shown here that a periodicity of Δ(z) ~ 0.6 is imprinted on the redshift-number distribution by this selection effect. Because this effect cannot be rigorously corrected for, astronomers need to be aware of it in any investigation that uses the SDSS N(z) distribution. Its presence also means that the SDSS quasar data cannot be used either to confirm or to rule out the Δ(z) ~ 0.6 redshift period reported previously in other, unrelated quasar data.\"</em></p>"},{"postName":"The Debate Over Redshift Quantization","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","redshift periodicity"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/redshift-quantization-debate/large.jpg","width":3072,"height":3072},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/redshift-quantization-debate/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/redshift-quantization-debate/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":3,"TileSize":256}}},{"id":"redshift-quantization-debate-paragraph-0","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","redshift periodicity"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/redshift-quantization-debate/large.jpg","width":3072,"height":3072},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/redshift-quantization-debate/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/redshift-quantization-debate/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":3,"TileSize":256}},"postParagraph":"<p>This debate needs to be mapped out for both sides.

This is clearly untrue because major emission lines can be seen with objective prism searches throughout the redshift range. Concentrations of redshifts close to z = 1 for optically selected quasars around companion galaxies and in dense groups of quasars prove that techniques of photographic discovery by ultraviolet excess are not significantly biased. Of course, quasars selected by their radio emission should not be biased in redshift at all. It is shown in Chapter 5 that all quasars tend to have certain rather discrete, permitted redshifts but that different groups have slightly different periods. It is the addition of these slightly shifted peaks from group to group which broadens the overall peaks as observed in the total quasar sample.

Acceleration would mean immediate jumps from five to ten miles per hour, then from ten to fifteen miles per hour, etc., with no apparent speeds in between.

This result alone indicates that the redshift may not be primarily due to motion.

In 1995 they submitted a paper to Astronomy and Astrophysics with the results from a further 97 spiral galaxies showing a 37.6 km/s quantization [30]. The prevailing wisdom said the quantization only appeared because of small number statistics, so the referees asked them to repeat their analysis with another set of galaxies. This Guthrie and Napier did with 117 other galaxies. The same 37.6 km/s quantization was plainly in evidence in this 1996 data set, and the referees accepted the paper [31]. A Fourier analysis of all 399 data points showed a huge spike at 37.6 km/s Statistically, the chance of this happening is about one in a million. The measurement error was about 1/10th the size of the quantization.

Tifft, Arp and others have pointed out that the quantized redshift means that the actual velocities of galaxies in clusters are very low [21, 38]. It is only at the very centers of clusters that high velocities would be expected. This was borne out by evidence mentioned at the Tucson conference on quantization in April 1996. Observations of the Virgo cluster have shown that in the innermost parts of the cluster 'deeper in the potential well, [galaxies] were moving fast enough to wash out the periodicity' [32]. Here, 'periodicity' is the quantization by another name. In other words, if galaxies have a significant velocity, it actually smears out the quantization. What we are seeing at the frontiers of the cosmos are extremely high redshifts. If these really were due to increasing speeds of expansion, we should not be seeing any quantizations in the measurements. They should be washed out. The Virgo cluster shows us this, as actual galaxy velocities in the center do smear out the redshift measurements. These results reveal that redshifts are not basically due to galaxy motion at all, but must have some other primary cause, with Doppler effects from motion merely being a secondary component.\"</em></p>"},{"id":"setterfield-quantized-redshifts-paragraph-20","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","william tifft","barry setterfield","redshift periodicity","quantized redshift"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/setterfield-quantized-redshifts/large.jpg","width":2048,"height":2048},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/setterfield-quantized-redshifts/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/setterfield-quantized-redshifts/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":3,"TileSize":512}},"postParagraph":"<p>[20].

The relation was later strongly confirmed over a much larger range in distance of the central galaxy and with larger numbers of examples in a paper by Arp in 1983. This is shown here in Figure 2-2.</em></p>"},{"id":"what-about-unassociated-quasars-paragraph-6","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"worldview","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","quasars, redshifts and controversies"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/what-about-unassociated-quasars/large.jpg","width":2048,"height":2048},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/what-about-unassociated-quasars/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/worldview/what-about-unassociated-quasars/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":3,"TileSize":512}},"postParagraph":"<p><em>At first sight this result seems to contradict the previous result that quasars fall closer to brighter, more nearby galaxies. The key point to understand, however, is that nearby quasars are statistically close (closer, on the average, than one would expect by chance) to nearby galaxies and that more distant quasars are statistically close to more distant galaxies. But, the nearby associations can subtend a large angle on the sky and have rather large separations compared to the separations involved in more distant associations. The difficulty comes when people assume on the local hypothesis (quasars closer than their redshift distances) that all quasars are at the same distance and then try to analyze this mixture of quasars at different distances with galaxies at different distances.

These objective prism quasars were analyzed to see how close on the sky they fell to NGC galaxies.

There are no accurate magnitude limits for this Catalog and in addition an inhomogeneous selection of objects was made.

Some authors have argued selection effects are responsible for the periodicities. This is clearly untrue because major emission lines can be seen with objective prism searches throughout the redshift range. Concentrations of redshifts close to z = 1 for optically selected quasars around companion galaxies and in dense groups of quasars prove that techniques of photographic discovery by ultraviolet excess are not significantly biased. Of course, quasars selected by their radio emission should not be biased in redshift at all. It is shown in Chapter 5 that all quasars tend to have certain rather discrete, permitted redshifts but that different groups have slightly different periods. It is the addition of these slightly shifted peaks from group to group which broadens the overall peaks as observed in the total quasar sample. The bottom line is that quasars have the astonishing property of occurring at certain preferred values of redshift, these values occurring with a definite period whose origin is a mystery at this moment.</em></p>"},{"id":"periodicity-investigators-paragraph-6","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"model","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","quasars, redshifts and controversies","redshift periodicity"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/model/periodicity-investigators/large.jpg","width":2048,"height":2048},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/model/periodicity-investigators/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/model/periodicity-investigators/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":2,"TileSize":512}},"postParagraph":"<p><em>The crucial discovery of periodicities in quasar redshifts was made by K.

Based on its appearance in the Arp Atlas, Peter Nilson described the feature as a 'sharp jet' in his 1973 Uppsala Galaxy Catalogue.</em></p>"},{"id":"arp-192-limb-paragraph-5","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"propositional","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","arp192","ngc3303"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/propositional/arp-192-limb/large.jpg","width":2358,"height":2358},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/propositional/arp-192-limb/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/propositional/arp-192-limb/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":5,"TileSize":256}},"postParagraph":"<p><em>Forty years after the Atlas was published, two astronomy writers, Jeff Kanipe and Dennis Webb, published their commemorative book 'The Arp Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies: A Chronicle and Observer’s Guide' (Willmann-Bell, 2006).

Eventually the results were shown to be incorrect. The consensus is that there are no low mass electron-positron states.' Franklin shows enough of the observed peaks observed in high energy heavy element collisons in accelerators to indicate the strength of the evidence. Some of them fit ratios of quasar redshift peaks. I can only remark that low mass electrons from nearby galaxies or quasars would be expected to show peaks at certain preferred values. Low mass electrons from higher redshift objects would have displaced peaks. In addition, this younger material is ejected intermittently in different directions from notoriously variable centers. I wonder why it was not possible just to say we do not have an explanation for these laboratory observations but perhaps it will become clearer as time goes on.

Phenomenologically, we can say that the increase of the intrinsic redshift in quasars as we consider younger matter seems to come from the lower particle (electron) masses. In the other direction, as the matter ages, the quasars show that their electrons do not increase in mass smoothly but rather in quantized steps of a factor of 1.23. The evidence from the smaller intrinsic redshift steps indicates that there is a fine structure between these large steps -- that the redshift drops in smaller quantized steps, but probably spending the most time in the strong resonances of the 1.23 factors. But what the factor 1.23 represents, or where it comes from, is very difficult to say at the moment.

On the other hand, objects that are far away have so large cosmological redshift that all other redshift components can be ignored. Generally an extragalactic object has cosmological redshift component that is proportional to its distance from us, and kinematical redshift component which usually is considered to be smaller than cz ~ 1000 km/s (although in some extreme cases even 3000 km/s has been accepted, NGC 1275 system is an example of that).

Companion galaxies might have an excess redshift component (Arp, 1994). Some higher redshift objects might be associated with lower redshift objects, as suggested by their apparent nearness, or by their geometrical alignment, or by apparent connecting bridges (Lopez-Corredoira, 2009). Supporting these, some strange coincidences in redshift values have been cited, such as redshifts of higher redshift objects decreasing when their location being further out from the lower redshift object (Arp, 1999), or redshift values clustering around certain values (Tifft, 1995).

Therefore it is OK for us to use heliocentric redshifts here, which is still most common frame where redshifts are given.\"</em></p>"},{"id":"redshift-components-paragraph-5","discourseLevel":"conceptual","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/conceptual/redshift-components/large.jpg","width":2048,"height":2048},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/conceptual/redshift-components/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/conceptual/redshift-components/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":2,"TileSize":512}},"postParagraph":"<p>See that webpage for a detailed explanation of how to calculate redshifts.</p>"},{"postName":"Halton Arp on the Difference Between Redshift and Recession Velocity","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"conceptual","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","quasars, redshifts and controversies","recession velocity"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/conceptual/redshift-vs-recession-velocity/large.jpg","width":1536,"height":1536},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/conceptual/redshift-vs-recession-velocity/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/conceptual/redshift-vs-recession-velocity/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":4,"TileSize":256}}},{"id":"redshift-vs-recession-velocity-paragraph-0","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"conceptual","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","quasars, redshifts and controversies","recession velocity"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/conceptual/redshift-vs-recession-velocity/large.jpg","width":1536,"height":1536},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/conceptual/redshift-vs-recession-velocity/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/conceptual/redshift-vs-recession-velocity/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":4,"TileSize":256}},"postParagraph":"<p><em>Quasars, Redshifts and Controversies</em>\nHalton Arp</p>"},{"id":"redshift-vs-recession-velocity-paragraph-1","card":"Halton Arp, the Modern Galileo","discourseLevel":"conceptual","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","quasars, redshifts and controversies","recession velocity"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/conceptual/redshift-vs-recession-velocity/large.jpg","width":1536,"height":1536},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/conceptual/redshift-vs-recession-velocity/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/conceptual/redshift-vs-recession-velocity/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":4,"TileSize":256}},"postParagraph":"<p><em>\"What every astronomer measures in the spectrum of a galaxy is the percentage by which a line is shifted from its laboratory wavelength.

Because astronomers knew the moon’s position very accurately they simply timed the disappearance and reappearance of the radio source as it was blocked (occulted) by the moon and converted the timing information into a position on the sky. The observations had to be repeated for another lunar occultation in order to resolve position ambiguity, because two points on the circular silhouette of the moon could produce the same time of disappearance. The second occultation would occur when the moon traveled along a slightly different path, and hence the timing information of two occultations could be combined to give an unambiguous position for the radio source. In this way the location of radio source 3C 273 was pinpointed by Cyril Hazard in Australia.

This magnetic field probably helps keep the jet under control and stable over long periods of time, otherwise the flow would become unstable—that is, lose its ordered structure—and quickly destroy itself.</em></p>"},{"id":"verschuur-agn-history-paragraph-30","discourseLevel":"conceptual","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","active galactic nucleus","3c273","3c48","3c279","ngc6251","m87","seyfert galaxies","jets"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/conceptual/verschuur-agn-history/large.jpg","width":2048,"height":2048},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/conceptual/verschuur-agn-history/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/conceptual/verschuur-agn-history/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":2,"TileSize":512}},"postParagraph":"<p><em>When radio doubles were first studied it was suspected that something had to be flowing out from the galaxy in order to inflate the radio lobes.

As the jets blast through space they draw energy from surrounding interstellar and intergalactic gases. To account for this, at least three mechanisms for adding energy to the relativistic particles have been proposed. Shocks, which are sudden discontinuities in the properties of the material involved, such as abrupt changes in density or motion, ahead of the jet and along its walls, create stronger magnetic fields, which in turn can accelerate particles. This process converts energy of bulk flow in the jet into relativistic energy of electrons; that is, the electrons are accelerated close to the speed of light.

This process, called entrainment, has interesting consequences. Whirlpools of matter, known as eddies, will be set up around the edge of a jet, just as in the wake of a ship. These eddies create shocks. The shocks can heat the gas to 10 million K and some of this gas then accumulates into dense pockets behind the shock. This entrained gas is predicted to cool to 10,000 K and show optical emission lines, which is observed in Cen A. By this time the gas will have moved as far as 30,000–300,000 light-years from the core. It is postulated that some of this gas will cool further, and stars will be formed, and this has been observed in Cen A. These stars will subsequently evolve, age, and die as they move out with the jet. Many will end their lives in explosive deaths known as supernovae and these explosions will, amazingly, become a significant source of new energy for the radio jets and lobes. Bear in mind that the material in the jets takes millions of years to reach the radio lobes, and therefore stars have plenty of time to be born and die during their journeys along these conduits into space. Entrainment, therefore, leads to a series of events, including star formation, which keeps the jet refueled and the radio source 'shining.'</em></p>"},{"id":"verschuur-agn-history-paragraph-34","discourseLevel":"conceptual","authors":["worldviewer"],"publishDate":"2017-04-30","updateDate":"2017-04-30","projectUrl":"","categories":["astronomy","astrophysics","cosmology","redshift","quasars","halton arp","active galactic nucleus","3c273","3c48","3c279","ngc6251","m87","seyfert galaxies","jets"],"metrics":[],"images":{"large":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/conceptual/verschuur-agn-history/large.jpg","width":2048,"height":2048},"thumbnail":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/conceptual/verschuur-agn-history/thumbnail.jpg"},"pyramid":{"url":"https://controversy-cards-feeds.s3.amazonaws.com/halton-arp-the-modern-galileo/conceptual/verschuur-agn-history/pyramid_files/","maxZoomLevel":2,"TileSize":512}},"postParagraph":"<p><em>12.2.
