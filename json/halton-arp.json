At an open meeting of astronomers, he eventually asked about what had been found. Arp says in his book, &#39;They replied that they had found no absorption.

					"unicode" : "\u003ci\u003eMarkarian 205 was reported by Weedman as a Seyfert nucleus appearing within the arms of the lower-redshift spiral galaxy NGC 4319. Most of the argument here has centered on whether or not there is a visible connection between the two. Pictures were published with and without a bridge (Arp once said that he had pictures that showed no bridge as well, and didn't want to be thought lacking in observational skill). There was some early discussion of photographic proximity effects creating false bridges between bright objects, but it doesn't go away with linear detectors. Various reports were given by Arp 1971 (ApLett 9,1), Lynds and Millikan 1972 (ApJLett 176, L5), Stockton et al 1979 (ApJ 231, 673), and Sulentic 1983 (ApJLett 265, L49). Cecil and Stockton (1985 ApJ 288, 201) used CCD data from Mauna Kea to show that there is definitely some kind of luminous object between Mkn 205 and NGC 4319, stating that 'Arp was correct in his insistence that his broad-band plates showed luminous intervening material. The opposite conclusions of his critics were - depending on their degree of qualification - either wrong, misleading, or irrelevant.' They go on to say that Mkn 205 itself has a companion 3.3 arcseconds away, and that a tidal feature attributable to this interaction probably accounts for much of the luminous connection. More problematic is the evidence that this connection winds its way all the way into the nucleus of NGC 4319 (Sulentic 1983). Furthermore, it belongs to the very select set of galaxies with peculiar, nonstellar ionization of gas throughout the disk (Sulentic and Arp 1987 ApJ 319, 693). I must point out that NGC 4319 has a bright elliptical companion which is usually outside the area of published pictures and might be responsible for some of its morphological woes. This system is well shown (though nothing much new shows up relevant to the redshift issue) in the Hubble Heritage image, shown below as is and with a brightness stretch to bring out the intervening material.\u003c/i\u003e"

It lies directly between Earth and galaxy NGC 7319 in Stephan&#39;s Quintet. It is indeed in front of its parent galaxy and is connected to it. The redshift of the quasar is 93.7 times that of the NGC 7319 galaxy that lies immediately behind it. But in accepted astronomy circles, this would mean the quasar is over 93 times farther away from us than is the big galaxy. Arp et al. show in their paper that the quasar is interacting with the material in front of the galaxy.

However, the image shown here received wide circulation on the Internet, where it was viewed by an increasingly vocal number of amateur astronomers and other interested viewers.

Often, when the intrinsic redshift evolves down to a certain value, the quasar starts to look like a small galaxy or BL Lac object [176] and begins to fall back, with still decreasing redshift values, toward its parent. Any additional redshift (over and above its intrinsic value) is indeed indicative of the object&#39;s velocity. But the intrinsic component is an indication of the object&#39;s youth and usually makes up the larger fraction of the object&#39;s total redshift.

The diffuse x-ray light in the image extends over several thousand light years, and is caused by multimillion-degree gas flowing out of M82. A close encounter with a large galaxy, M81, in the last 100 million years is thought to be the cause of the starburst activity.&#39;&#39; [Emphasis added.]\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;Hot gas&#39; must be extremely hot to radiate X-rays. Even orthodox astronomers will admit that all the atoms in such a hot gas are ionized and that the &#39;gas&#39; is actually a plasma. But the electrical properties of a plasma can cause it to emit x-rays at much lower temperatures. Because astronomers are unaware of such properties, they must call upon the much weaker properties of gravity to supply the energy. Mathematical extrapolation indicates that the necessary energy would be available if matter were concentrated into a &#39;black-hole.&#39; Although no black hole has ever been observed, the presence of one is often inferred and then announced as fact -- as it is here.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn the image shown in figure 71, a string of at least five high-intensity, young, x-ray-emitting plasmoids (quasars?) extends along the spin axis of M82. There is a high level of plasma activity. High-amplitude electric currents undoubtedly are producing large pinch forces that create these objects. No black-hole magic is needed.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIf there is a black hole in the middle of each of these objects, why is matter pouring out rather than in?

					"unicode" : "\u003ci\u003eA detailed discussion of Einstein&#39;s General Relativity Theory is well beyond the scope of this book. However, for completeness, we should briefly discuss how Arp&#39;s work impinges on the assumptions that were made in solving Einstein&#39;s famous equation. That equation can be written, in its simplest form, as [191]\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eG=T,\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003ewhere T represents the energy and momentum of a system of particles and G describes the geometry (e.g., curvature of space-time) of the space in which the particles reside. Note carefully that this postulated relationship does not explicitly include any electrical or magnetic phenomena.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn 1922 a Russian mathematician, Alexander Friedmann, derived a solution to the general form of this equation, which yielded the now famous result that the spatial separations of the particles in the cosmos have to increase with time. This was the genesis of the notion that space itself was expanding. The very coordinate system in which we measure the positions of objects in the universe was blowing up. Redshift could be decoupled from recessional velocity, distance could be made &#39;stretchable,&#39; and the Big Bang could be anchored to a non-empirical mathematical structure into which any observation could be subsumed. It was overlooked that such a deduced hypothesis was not falsifiable and thus made cosmology into a pseudoscience. It was not until 1977 that mathematician Jayant Narlikar [192] pointed out that Friedmann&#39;s solution had assumed that the total mass of all the particles in the universe remained constant in time. Narlikar did not make that particular assumption and obtained a different solution -- one wherein m = at^2. This result indicates that the mass of the cosmos increases at a rate that is proportional to the square of the age of that mass. It isn&#39;t the size of the universe that is getting larger -- it is its mass.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eArp points out in his book Seeing Red [193] that &#39;the most useful feature of the Narlikar solution is that it explains [my] preceding book[s] full of observations. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIf particle masses are a function of time, then younger (more recently created) electrons have smaller masses. When a less massive electron makes a transition between atomic orbits, the photon involved has a lower energy and the resulting spectral line is redshifted. The consistent lesson of the observations we have discussed is, the younger the object, the higher the intrinsic redshift.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eEinstein was not necessarily wrong when he postulated his relation. The error lay in the assumptions made by others when they solved that equation. It was wrong to presume that the mass of the cosmos is constant. That single faulty assumption has led to the present disaster of curved spacetime, expanding space, Big Bang, Dark Energy, inflation theory, and a host of immeasurable, nonsense quantities -- none of which can be observed. Contrast all this to Narlikar&#39;s elegant, closed-form solution of the Einstein equation. This solution results in a conclusion that has been repeatedly verified by Arp&#39;s experimental evidence -- his observations and his images.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eDr. Halton Arp&#39;s contributions to observational astronomy and the way he has been treated by the majority of the astronomical community are reminiscent of the story of Plato&#39;s cave [194]. Imagine a dark, cave-like prison in which humans are bound by their necks to a single place from infancy. All they can see are shadows on the opposite wall of the cave. The real objects are beyond their field of vision. A fire behind the real objects creates the shadows. The prisoners do not recognize their imprisonment and are satisfied to live their lives in this way. Then one man gets free and struggles to where he sees the real objects. This freed prisoner now understands the shadows to be imperfect, twisted copies of the full reality now grasped in his mind. But when he is returned to the prison, the freed prisoner becomes the object of ridicule, disbelief, and hostility. His observations are rejected as being &#39;obviously flawed.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAny unbiased scientific examination of Arp&#39;s images will quickly lead to the conclusion that it is not his evidence and his images that are flawed. Rather, the flaw is in the established and convoluted theory at whose foundation lies a mistaken solution of Einstein&#39;s postulate, the unwarranted presumption that the total mass of the universe must be a constant and the now falsified assumption that &#39;redshift implies large distance and recessional velocity.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eReal evidence leads us to conclude that Halton Arp is correct in his contention that redshift is caused mainly by an object&#39;s being young and only secondarily because of its velocity. Therefore, quasars are not the brightest, most distant, and most rapidly moving objects in the observed universe -- but they are among the youngest. And the Virgo galaxy cluster most certainly does not have the shape of a long &#39;Finger of God&#39; pointed directly at Earth. And the universe is not expanding.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eWe have noted that Arp&#39;s contention that quasars and BL Lac objects are ejected from active galactic nuclei is somewhat contrary to Peratt&#39;s and Alfven&#39;s theory that they are formed in place by z-pinches in cosmic Birkeland currents. But these two proposed mechanisms are not contradictory: Arp&#39;s ejection is accompanied by much plasma activity; Peratt&#39;s z-pinches occur in plasma streaming out of a galaxy along its axial current. In either case, the hypothesis is antithetical to the Big Bang Theory. Both agree that quasars are in close proximity to (and in dozens of cases connected to) their central galaxies.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe story of Halton Arp demonstrates the extent to which the astrophysics power structure will go in defending their theories and assumptions even when confronted with clearly falsifying evidence. Worst of all are their attempts to stifle Arp&#39;s publications.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eWhat can be called &#39;The Arp Affair&#39; should have been stopped early on by heeding Carl Sagan&#39;s judgment: &#39;The suppression of uncomfortable ideas may be common in religion or in politics, but it is not the path to knowledge, and there&#39;s no place for it in the endeavor of science.&#39;&quot;\u003c/i\u003e"

If two objects are connected, they cannot be cosmically distant from one another. It is just that simple. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eArp&#39;s photographs disprove both the &#39;redshift equals distance&#39; and &#39;redshift equals recessional velocity&#39; assumptions.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eResearcher Amy Acheson pointed out:\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;Halton Arp&#39;s observations show that the assumption that high redshift implies velocity never really was valid. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eArp shows, one galaxy grouping at a time, that the smaller and fainter (high-redshift) galaxies really are smaller and fainter, but not necessarily farther away.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e They are connected to, interacting with, and possibly ejected from the larger and brighter (low-redshift) galaxies.

[159] \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eProfessional astronomers were quick to say that they &#39;cannot see any physical connection&#39; between these two objects.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e They have at their disposal the Hubble Space Telescope, the Chandra x-ray orbiting observatory, and all of the big scopes of Kitt Peak, Hawaii, and Chile. But they cannot see the connection that Arp saw. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eLately they have admitted that there may be an &#39;apparent&#39; connection, but that it is only a &#39;mirage.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eOf course, if there actually is a physical connection, then the Big Bang Theory is in trouble.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eOn April 4, 2002, amateur astronomer John Smith of Oro Valley, AZ, obtained an image of the two objects mentioned above: NGC 4319 and Markarian 205 (Mrk 205). I then quantized the light levels in that image to show isophote (similar brightness) contours. This result is shown in figure 64.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn that image, Mrk 205 is the small appendage below the main galaxy. It is clearly connected to the main body of NGC 4319.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn processing this image, I used level quantization (staircase gray curves in the Picture Window Pro 3.1 software package) followed by the &#39;Edge tool.&#39; [160] Notice that, of all the small objects surrounding the main galaxy, only Mrk 205&#39;s shape is stretched back toward NGC 4319. None of the other objects in close proximity to 4319 is extended in this manner.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eOn October 7, 2002, the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) published an HST161 image of these same objects. The orientation is different, but the connection is again clearly visible. After processing the HST image exactly as was done with the first amateur image, I obtained the image shown in figure 65. It is obvious the larger galaxy (NGC 4319) in these images is physically connected to its small companion quasar. Notice, in figure 65, the three small clumps of matter situated along the line connecting the center of Mrk 205 to the larger galaxy.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe official explanation of the NASA image states:\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;Appearances can be deceiving. In this NASA Hubble Space Telescope image, an odd celestial duo, the spiral galaxy NGC 4319 [center] and a quasar called Markarian 205 [upper right], appear to be neighbors. In reality, the two objects don&#39;t even live in the same city. They are separated by time and space. NGC 4319 is 80 million light-years from Earth. Markarian 205 is more than 14 times farther away, residing 1 billion light-years from Earth. The apparent close alignment of Mrk 205 and NGC 4319 is simply a matter of chance.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eEstablishment astronomers deny that there is any physical connection between this pair and assert that the obvious bridge between the two objects &#39;must be&#39; an illusion. But this &#39;must be&#39; only arises from their predilection to believe in a cherished theory despite empirical evidence. When a pair of amateur astronomers such as John and myself are able to get and process images that the professionals &#39;cannot see,&#39; one has to wonder whether those experts are just being stubborn in defense of their assumptions or are in a psychological state of total denial. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eInterestingly, the HST image of NGC 4319 and Mrk 205 was obtained under the amateur HST request program that NASA had been supporting for a long time prior to when this image was downloaded. Very soon afterward, the request program was terminated.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn his first book [162] Arp says that a favorite practice of his detractors is to look for absorption lines in the spectrum of the low-redshift (supposedly closer) object that correspond to emission lines in the quasar. This, they say, proves that the quasar is behind the low redshift galaxy. But when such absorption lines are not found, this could just as well be interpreted as proof that the quasar is in front of the galaxy. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn the case of NGC 4319 and Mrk 205, no such announcement was made. Arp knew they had looked for the absorption lines, spending a great deal of time with the Hale 200-inch scope on Mt. Palomar doing so. At an open meeting of astronomers, he eventually asked about what had been found. Arp says in his book, &#39;They replied that they had found no absorption. What seemed to me quite devastating was that they had to publicly admit that they had not published information gained from those enormous amounts of large telescope time, that they had withheld this important scientific information, apparently because it did not agree with the position to which they were committed.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eRecently it has been announced that absorption spectra have indeed been observed in NGC 4319 at the redshifted emission lines in Mrk 205. Arp&#39;s opponents say this proves that Mrk 205 is at an enormous &#39;cosmological distance&#39; from Earth. But the observed lines are at an intensity of only about 10% of the absorption lines seen in control galaxy tests. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eArp claims that this observation simply proves that Mrk 205 has not yet completely emerged from the disk of its ejecting parent, so we are seeing about 10% of that parent galaxy still in front of the quasar.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIf this were the only piece of evidence, one might conclude that it was insufficient, on its own, to justify throwing out the Big Bang Theory. But Arp has more -- much more.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAnother example of two or more connected objects that have different redshift values is galaxy NGC 7603 and the quasar that is linked to it by a bridge of luminous matter. If redshift really implies distance, then the bright companion quasar (Object 1) must be twice as far away as the main galaxy. However, in figure 66, it is obvious that the two are physically connected.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eFurthermore two additional quasars have been discovered [163] inside the bridge of matter connecting Object 1 to NGC 7603.

The redshifts of the two galaxies which are apparently connected by a luminous filament are z=0.029 and z=0.057 respectively. We show that in the luminous filament there are two compact emission line objects with z=0.243 and z=0.391. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThey lie exactly on the line traced by the filament connecting the galaxies.

The point is that any scientific claim must be falsifiable. To hold that redshift is an absolute indicator of distance must be to allow standards of evidence that will overturn that position. NGC 7603 is evidence which meets that standard, and if it is not sufficient to overturn the standard model all on its own, it is strong enough to require addressing by the proponents of the standard model.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eBut again an important point is that these cases are not alone. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eArp and his associates have collected hundreds of similar close associations of highredshift quasars and low-redshift galaxies.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eArp has commented [165] on how a similar case was received by the professional astronomical community:\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;A reasonable response would be to notice such a case and say, &#39;If I see a few more cases like this I will have to believe it is real&#39; Most astronomers say, \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003e&#39;This violates proven physics [i.e., their assumptions] and therefore must be invalid.

NGC 1232 [172] is also known as Arp 41. It is a magnitude 9.9 spiral galaxy with a small secondary spiral on the end of one of its arms. The small companion, NGC 1232A, has a redshift four times that of the large galaxy. [173] Under accepted theory, this requires the small companion to be over four times farther away from us than the large galaxy.

Mainstream defenders of the Big Bang throw up all sorts of probabilistic arguments against Arp&#39;s connected objects.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eOne might think, however, that if anyone were ever to find a quasar directly in front of a bright, low-redshift galaxy, then that would clearly constitute absolute falsification of the notion that these high-redshift objects must be at their extremely remote &#39;cosmological&#39; distances (as dictated by the redshift equals distance assumrtion).\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eDr. Arp and his associates [174] have discovered just such a quasar (Figure 70a). It lies directly between Earth and galaxy NGC 7319 in Stephan&#39;s Quintet. It is indeed in front of its parent galaxy and is connected to it. The redshift of the quasar is 93.7 times that of the NGC 7319 galaxy that lies immediately behind it. But in accepted astronomy circles, this would mean the quasar is over 93 times farther away from us than is the big galaxy. Arp et al. show in their paper that the quasar is interacting with the material in front of the galaxy. There is a jet of matter reaching out from the center of the galaxy toward the quasar.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe centers of Seyfert galaxies like NGC 7319 are opaque -- we cannot see through them. We cannot even see into the cores of such galaxies let alone what is behind them. Thus, this quasar found superimposed on the face of this nearby low-redshift Seyfert galaxy obviously has to be closer to us than the galaxy. This discovery should force the final and absolute demise of the main assumptions that led to the Big Bang theory -- the assumptions that high redshift implies great distance and recessional velocity.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eArp and his colleagues submitted a paper for publication announcing the discovery.

However, the image shown here received wide circulation on the Internet, where it was viewed by an increasingly vocal number of amateur astronomers and other interested viewers.

As they move away, their redshift decreases. Often, when the intrinsic redshift evolves down to a certain value, the quasar starts to look like a small galaxy or BL Lac object [176] and begins to fall back, with still decreasing redshift values, toward its parent. Any additional redshift (over and above its intrinsic value) is indeed indicative of the object&#39;s velocity. But the intrinsic component is an indication of the object&#39;s youth and usually makes up the larger fraction of the object&#39;s total redshift.

However, they all agree with Arp that the quasars are physically associated with their parent galaxies.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e All agree that the occurrence of the Big Bang is now extremely doubtful.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn addition to the above evidence, the intrinsic redshift z values of quasars seem to be quantized.

These are some of the brightest such objects known. The luminosity of the x-ray binaries suggests that most contain a black hole. The diffuse x-ray light in the image extends over several thousand light years, and is caused by multimillion-degree gas flowing out of M82.

Arp points out that the Virgo cluster is much more compact than it appears in the lower diagram. A plot of the correct distance distribution is shown in the diagram at the upper left in figure 74.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eHow astronomers can continue to look at this diagram and not realize that something is wrong with the &#39;redshift equals distance&#39; idea is evidence of how blinded by this assumption they have become.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003ci\u003e Like the Church in Galileo&#39;s day, refusing to open its eyes to any version of the order of the cosmos but its own, today&#39;s astrophysicists have closed their eyes and minds to observations that might disprove their dogma.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eCarl Sagan put it this way, &#39;You can&#39;t convince a believer of anything; for their belief is not based on evidence, it&#39;s based on a deep seated need to believe.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIt is ironic to remember that Galileo got into trouble with the Church by promoting the work of Copernicus who said that Earth is not the center of anything. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn pointing out the erroneous nature of the Fingers of God diagram, Arp is indeed today&#39;s Galileo.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eA detailed discussion of Einstein&#39;s General Relativity Theory is well beyond the scope of this book. However, for completeness, we should briefly discuss how Arp&#39;s work impinges on the assumptions that were made in solving Einstein&#39;s famous equation. That equation can be written, in its simplest form, as [191]\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eG=T,\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003ewhere T represents the energy and momentum of a system of particles and G describes the geometry (e.g., curvature of space-time) of the space in which the particles reside. Note carefully that this postulated relationship does not explicitly include any electrical or magnetic phenomena.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eIn 1922 a Russian mathematician, Alexander Friedmann, derived a solution to the general form of this equation, which yielded the now famous result that the spatial separations of the particles in the cosmos have to increase with time. This was the genesis of the notion that space itself was expanding. The very coordinate system in which we measure the positions of objects in the universe was blowing up. Redshift could be decoupled from recessional velocity, distance could be made &#39;stretchable,&#39; and the Big Bang could be anchored to a non-empirical mathematical structure into which any observation could be subsumed. It was overlooked that such a deduced hypothesis was not falsifiable and thus made cosmology into a pseudoscience. It was not until 1977 that mathematician Jayant Narlikar [192] pointed out that Friedmann&#39;s solution had assumed that the total mass of all the particles in the universe remained constant in time. Narlikar did not make that particular assumption and obtained a different solution -- one wherein m = at^2. This result indicates that the mass of the cosmos increases at a rate that is proportional to the square of the age of that mass. It isn&#39;t the size of the universe that is getting larger -- it is its mass.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eArp points out in his book Seeing Red [193] that &#39;the most useful feature of the Narlikar solution is that it explains [my] preceding book[s] full of observations. \u003c/i\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003ci\u003eIf particle masses are a function of time, then younger (more recently created) electrons have smaller masses. When a less massive electron makes a transition between atomic orbits, the photon involved has a lower energy and the resulting spectral line is redshifted. The consistent lesson of the observations we have discussed is, the younger the object, the higher the intrinsic redshift.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eEinstein was not necessarily wrong when he postulated his relation. The error lay in the assumptions made by others when they solved that equation. It was wrong to presume that the mass of the cosmos is constant. That single faulty assumption has led to the present disaster of curved spacetime, expanding space, Big Bang, Dark Energy, inflation theory, and a host of immeasurable, nonsense quantities -- none of which can be observed. Contrast all this to Narlikar&#39;s elegant, closed-form solution of the Einstein equation. This solution results in a conclusion that has been repeatedly verified by Arp&#39;s experimental evidence -- his observations and his images.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eDr. Halton Arp&#39;s contributions to observational astronomy and the way he has been treated by the majority of the astronomical community are reminiscent of the story of Plato&#39;s cave [194]. Imagine a dark, cave-like prison in which humans are bound by their necks to a single place from infancy. All they can see are shadows on the opposite wall of the cave. The real objects are beyond their field of vision. A fire behind the real objects creates the shadows. The prisoners do not recognize their imprisonment and are satisfied to live their lives in this way. Then one man gets free and struggles to where he sees the real objects. This freed prisoner now understands the shadows to be imperfect, twisted copies of the full reality now grasped in his mind. But when he is returned to the prison, the freed prisoner becomes the object of ridicule, disbelief, and hostility. His observations are rejected as being &#39;obviously flawed.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eAny unbiased scientific examination of Arp&#39;s images will quickly lead to the conclusion that it is not his evidence and his images that are flawed. Rather, the flaw is in the established and convoluted theory at whose foundation lies a mistaken solution of Einstein&#39;s postulate, the unwarranted presumption that the total mass of the universe must be a constant and the now falsified assumption that &#39;redshift implies large distance and recessional velocity.&#39;\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eReal evidence leads us to conclude that Halton Arp is correct in his contention that redshift is caused mainly by an object&#39;s being young and only secondarily because of its velocity. Therefore, quasars are not the brightest, most distant, and most rapidly moving objects in the observed universe -- but they are among the youngest. And the Virgo galaxy cluster most certainly does not have the shape of a long &#39;Finger of God&#39; pointed directly at Earth. And the universe is not expanding.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eWe have noted that Arp&#39;s contention that quasars and BL Lac objects are ejected from active galactic nuclei is somewhat contrary to Peratt&#39;s and Alfven&#39;s theory that they are formed in place by z-pinches in cosmic Birkeland currents. But these two proposed mechanisms are not contradictory: Arp&#39;s ejection is accompanied by much plasma activity; Peratt&#39;s z-pinches occur in plasma streaming out of a galaxy along its axial current. In either case, the hypothesis is antithetical to the Big Bang Theory. Both agree that quasars are in close proximity to (and in dozens of cases connected to) their central galaxies.\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\u003ci\u003eThe story of Halton Arp demonstrates the extent to which the astrophysics power structure will go in defending their theories and assumptions even when confronted with clearly falsifying evidence.
